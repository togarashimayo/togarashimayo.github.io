I checked in panelists in my assigned room, observed and evaluated their panels, and fixed technical issues. I joined the con&rsquo;s year-round team in Spring 2018 and became panel coordinator in Fall 2018.</p><p>After the Summer 2019 con, it was time to leave the year-round team and make my next move: run my own panels!</p><p>Because of my past background, I can see panels from a staffer&rsquo;s perspective. I understand how conventions pick panels including how they see specific types of panels, how panel moderators evaluate my performance and factor it in during future intakes, and how to make the most out of (while not stressing) my panel coordinator. Knowing those concepts help with pitching and delivery, as it helps me show value in my work (be it to the attendees or to my coordinator).</p><p>While I don&rsquo;t know <em>everything</em> about anime fan wants, I do also understand a want for edutaining panels. I attempt to deliver on that want by using video clips, trivia, jokes, and personal anecdotes to engage the audience and ensuring that:</p><ol><li>The panel is enjoyable yet educational for those new to the subject matter.</li><li>The veterans gain a new perspective on concepts they&rsquo;re familiar with.</li></ol><p><em>"<a href=https://twitter.com/MichaelToole/status/1554256205903790080>[Otaku&rsquo;s Guide to] Donghua.
