I checked in panelists in my assigned room, observed and evaluated their panels, and fixed technical issues. I joined the con&rsquo;s year-round team in Spring 2018 and became panel coordinator in Fall 2018.</p><p>After the Summer 2019 con, it was time to leave the year-round team and make my next move: run my own panels!</p><p>Because of my past background, I can see panels from a staffer&rsquo;s perspective. I understand how conventions pick panels including how they see specific types of panels, how panel moderators evaluate my performance and factor it in during future intakes, and how to make the most out of (while not stressing) my panel coordinator. Knowing those concepts help with pitching and delivery, as it helps me show value in my work (be it to the attendees or to my coordinator).</p><p>While I don&rsquo;t know <em>everything</em> about anime fan wants, I do also understand a want for edutaining panels. I attempt to deliver on that want by using video clips, trivia, jokes, and personal anecdotes to engage the audience and ensuring that:</p><ol><li>The panel is enjoyable yet educational for those new to the subject matter.</li><li>The veterans gain a new perspective on concepts they&rsquo;re familiar with.</li></ol><h3 id=what-are-people-saying-about-my-work>What are people saying about my work?</h3><p><em>"<a href=https://twitter.com/MichaelToole/status/1554256205903790080>[Otaku&rsquo;s Guide to] Donghua.

Chan was immensely knowledgeable about the topic and quickly backed her points up with reliable sources and examples. Her delivery was strong, with a wry sense of humor that helped to keep a breezy tone when discussing even the heaviest topics. At the same time, her video clips and visual aids were both exemplary, being relevant and entertaining in equal measure, while helping to elevate the overall subject matter.</a>"</em> - Samantha Ferreira (of Anime Herald) on attending Anime in the Philippines at Otakon 2024.</p><h3 id=gear>Gear</h3><p><strong>Panel creation</strong>:</p><ul><li>Presentation software - Microsoft PowerPoint</li><li>Video downloading and creation software - 4K Video Downloader, OBS, and ClipChamp</li><li>Subtitles - Aegisub and Handbrake</li><li>Graphic design - Figma (title cards and closing bumpers) and Waifu2x</li><li>Research + Ideation - Notion (previously used OneNote)</li><li>Panel-running device - Microsoft Surface Pro 8 (256 GB)</li><li>Website updates - GitHub and Visual Studio Code (no extensions at this time)</li></ul><p><strong>Cooking</strong>:</p><ul><li>Chef&rsquo;s knife - Dalstrong Gladiator 8"</li><li>Paring knife - Wüsthof Classic utility knife 4"</li><li>Bread knife - Victorinox 7" (wooden handle)</li></ul><p>(While I got the respective chef and paring knives as gifts, I agree with a good amount of r/KitchenConfidential users about how Victorinox is solid.)</p><h2 id=and-out-of-it>&mldr;and out of it</h2><ul><li>I studied software development and currently work as a back-end developer for a non-tech company, with goals of both furthering my domain knowledge while earning the respective AWS associate Solutions Architect and Developer certifications.
