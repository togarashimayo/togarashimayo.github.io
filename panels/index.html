I also include this page in my panel applications, where I let it do the talking for my previous experience - you can only include so much information in a webform without that info resembling a wall of text!</p><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>All panels are 50-60 minutes by default.</li><li>I need a projector with HDMI support, a speaker system, a microphone with a stand, and access to a power outlet for my laptop - all of which should be present in a typical convention&rsquo;s panel room.</li><li>An HDMI to USB-C adapter (in case mine borks), an extra microphone with a stand (for a workaround in case the audio jack borks), a chair, a table, and drinking water (such as water bottles or a water jug with cups) are nice to haves.</li><li>For panel coordinators (both current and prospective): My panels come with customization options and you can request a view-only copy of my previous work. If you would like something added, changed, or omitted within reason, please contact me before you start sending out offer letters to accepted panelists.</li><li>I want to make my panels the best they can be. Any constructive feedback (including questions, comments, and concerns) that you might have is appreciated - please email or message them to me!</li></ul><h2>Current lineup</h2><div class=convention><h3>Eat Ostania: The Food of Spy x Family (13+)</h3><i>While not really a food anime, Spy x Family showcases plenty of mouth-watering food along with the usual Forger family shenanigans.
