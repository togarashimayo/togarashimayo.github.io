  - This is my most popular panel (even overtaking Donghua, my previous flagship) since I started running it at Anime North 2023.
  - Some of the other topics I cover include anime broadcasting in the Philippines, historical events that have clear and direct implications for anime in the country, and random Philippine facts woven in-between (such as the 2022-2023 onion crisis).
