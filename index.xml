Before becoming a panelist of my own, I volunteered for the big anime convention in my city, where I specialized in panelist relations as part of the con&amp;rsquo;s Programming department - be it moderating panel rooms as an at-con or screening panels as a year-round.
Because of my past background, I can see panels from a staffer&amp;rsquo;s perspective.</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/credits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/credits/</guid><description>Credits I plan and produce many of the things you see in the panel room, but I do need help sometimes!

We&amp;rsquo;d write a vision (or two) outlining what our future would look like, before writing some short-term SMART goals to hit before a certain timeframe (in the workplace&amp;rsquo;s case, every four months or a quarter). The visions would then be published on a company-wide spreadsheet where we&amp;rsquo;d be held accountable for them near the end of each quarter.</description></item></channel></rss>
