My opinions echo [ENW regular] from her late 2022 review (link in the comments) on how soft, airy, and well-balanced it is. However, I also like how the croissant breaks into satisfying flakes when biting into it.
I&amp;rsquo;m more partial to Beaucoup, but this is a place I can see myself swinging by again to try their drinks and flavoured croissants!</description></item><item><title>Candy Alley</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/candy-alley/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/candy-alley/</guid><description>Candy Alley (2024-04-10) Candy Alley is a local candy store in Downtown New West. The owner (hereafter, &amp;ldquo;Sheryl&amp;rdquo;) is a massive trip!
One-liner: Reasonably-priced Birchwood Dairy ice cream scoops from a local candy store.
Disclosure: Sheryl gave me a free scoop in exchange for my honest thoughts and agreeing to stagger this write-up by a week so she can procure ice cream cones.
During my last Candy Alley visit last Wednesday, Sheryl Laine asked me if I&amp;rsquo;d like to try her handmade ice cream.</description></item><item><title>Greens and Beans</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/greens-and-beans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/greens-and-beans/</guid><description>Greens and Beans Greens and Beans is a deli that is well-known among Eat New West members (let alone New West in general), because the owner (hereafter, &amp;ldquo;Leona&amp;rdquo;) is both an active member and a community pillar. One of the fun things I do each time I show up is to order a soup flight where I prioritize soups I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet.

2024-06-22 &amp;ldquo;Neues Bayern Haus&amp;rdquo; (ie. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;New Bavaria Haus&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;) is what I refer to Old Bavaria Haus&amp;rsquo;s current state in front of Amelie, Mira, and Zerogouki, as we&amp;rsquo;re quite familiar with the building owners&amp;rsquo; background. I picked up everything from Amelie&amp;rsquo;s residence in Coquitlam, rather than her commissary kitchen. I am heading to Germany between late September and early-mid October.</description></item><item><title>The Tannenbaum</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/tannenbaum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/tannenbaum/</guid><description>The Tannenbaum &amp;ldquo;Do you want me to drive to Save-On Foods?&amp;rdquo; - the owner (hereafter, &amp;ldquo;Mira&amp;rdquo;) when telling a table that she&amp;rsquo;s out of black forest cake.
If you know me personally, follow me on social media, or attended the first few minutes of Anime in the Philippines at Sakura-Con or Otakon 2024, you might know that I stan like this German restaurant very much. Keichoro&amp;rsquo;s birthday dinner did a good job at hyping me up considering my German language-learning interests, with Mira speedrunning her way into converting me into a repeat (and then a regular) customer after I did a walk-in two months later.</description></item><item><title>Writings</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/</guid><description>Writings A list of my writings.
Eat New West Eat New West is a FB group dedicated to documenting people&amp;rsquo;s food adventures in the titular city and in adjacent areas. I&amp;rsquo;m a member of the group as my hair salon is in New West, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to find more delicious eats beyond ramen and German food. It is also where I hone my food writing skills, by painting a picture of the places I&amp;rsquo;ve been to.</description></item><item><title>Books</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/more/books/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/more/books/</guid><description>Booklist A (mostly) up-to-date of books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read, are currently reading, or want to read.

I checked in panelists in my assigned room, observed and evaluated their panels, and fixed technical issues. I joined the con&amp;rsquo;s year-round team in Spring 2018 and became panel coordinator in Fall 2018.
After the Summer 2019 con, it was time to leave the year-round team and make my next move: run my own panels!</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/credits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/credits/</guid><description>Credits I plan and produce many of the things you see in the panel room, but I do need help sometimes!

We&amp;rsquo;d write a vision (or two) outlining what our future would look like, before writing some short-term SMART goals to hit before a certain timeframe (in the workplace&amp;rsquo;s case, every four months or a quarter). The visions would then be published on a company-wide spreadsheet where we&amp;rsquo;d be held accountable for them near the end of each quarter.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/dehls-gourmet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/dehls-gourmet/</guid><description>Dehl&amp;rsquo;s Gourmet (2024-08-11) Dehl&amp;rsquo;s Gourmet is a African restaurant near the Quay.
Someone on ENW created a Facebook reel raving about Dehl&amp;rsquo;s Gourmet, claiming that we should &amp;ldquo;keep scrolling&amp;rdquo; if our name isn&amp;rsquo;t [ENW regular]. My name obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t [ENW regular], but [ENW user]&amp;rsquo;s reel made me pop by Dehl&amp;rsquo;s Gourmet yesterday after lunch.
But unlike [ENW user], I went with the veggie patty instead of the beef patty. The patty does have the right amount of spice akin to a veggie samosa from a well-respected Indian place.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/greens-and-bakd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/greens-and-bakd/</guid><description>Greens and Beans x BAK&amp;rsquo;D (2024-06-21) Dave Merrill is the &amp;ldquo;anime convention friend who seems to be around Leona&amp;rsquo;s age&amp;rdquo;, although he addresses me using the hard &amp;ldquo;ch&amp;rdquo; (rather than the soft &amp;ldquo;ch&amp;rdquo; like Leona)&amp;quot; One-liners:
