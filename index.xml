I checked in panelists in my assigned room, observed and evaluated their panels, and fixed technical issues. I joined the con&amp;rsquo;s year-round team in Spring 2018 and became panel coordinator in Fall 2018.
After the Summer 2019 con, it was time to leave the year-round team and make my next move: run my own panels!</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/credits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/credits/</guid><description>Credits I plan and produce many of the things you see in the panel room, but I do need help sometimes!

We&amp;rsquo;d write a vision (or two) outlining what our future would look like, before writing some short-term SMART goals to hit before a certain timeframe (in the workplace&amp;rsquo;s case, every four months or a quarter). The visions would then be published on a company-wide spreadsheet where we&amp;rsquo;d be held accountable for them near the end of each quarter.</description></item></channel></rss>
