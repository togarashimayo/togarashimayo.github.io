The owner (hereafter, &amp;ldquo;Sheryl&amp;rdquo;) is a massive trip!
One-liner: Reasonably-priced Birchwood Dairy ice cream scoops from a local candy store.
Disclosure: Sheryl gave me a free scoop in exchange for my honest thoughts and agreeing to stagger this write-up by a week so she can procure ice cream cones.
During my last Candy Alley visit last Wednesday, Sheryl Laine asked me if I&amp;rsquo;d like to try her handmade ice cream.</description></item><item><title>Greens and Beans</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/greens_and_beans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/greens_and_beans/</guid><description>Greens and Beans (2024-03-02) Greens and Beans is a deli that is well-known among Eat New West members (let alone New West in general), because the owner (hereafter, &amp;ldquo;Leona&amp;rdquo;) is both an active member and a community pillar.
We live in Vancouver, but my partner and I swung by Greens and Beans on our way to pick up our MunChi order (write-up on the way here!) - I&amp;rsquo;ve heard many good things about the deli from this group, especially their soup flights!</description></item><item><title>MunChi Foods</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/munchi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/munchi/</guid><description>MunChi Foods (2024-03-02) MunChi is a German food concept in a Port Moody commissary kitchen that&amp;rsquo;s best known for its pretzels. The owner (hereafter, &amp;ldquo;Amelie&amp;rdquo;) was supposed to take over Old Bavaria Haus management, but she pulled out of the Old Bavaria Haus agreement on March 18 2024. Again, she did the right thing knowing the building owners&amp;rsquo; iffy behaviour.
The promised Greens and Beans write-up sequel for MunChi&amp;hellip;
One-liner: Amazing pretzels, schnitzel sandwiches, and service that‚Äôs worth the Port Moody trip until Amelie moves into Old Bavaria Haus (‚ÄùOBH‚Äù) this May.</description></item><item><title>The Tannenbaum</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/tannenbaum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/tannenbaum/</guid><description>The Tannenbaum If you know me personally, follow me on social media, or attended the first few minutes of Anime in the Philippines at Sakura-Con 2024, you might know that I stan like this German restaurant very much. Keichoro&amp;rsquo;s birthday dinner did a good job at hyping me up, with the owner (hereafter &amp;ldquo;Mira&amp;rdquo;, the older lady often doing FOH stuff) working her magic to convert me into a repeat (and then a regular) customer after I did a walk-in two months later.</description></item><item><title>Writings</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/writings/</guid><description>Writings A list of my writings.
Eat New West Eat New West is a FB group dedicated to documenting people&amp;rsquo;s food adventures in the titular city and in adjacent areas. I&amp;rsquo;m a member of the group as my hair salon is in New West, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to find more delicious eats beyond ramen and German food. It is also where I hone my food writing skills, by painting a picture of the places I&amp;rsquo;ve been to.</description></item><item><title>Books</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/more/books/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/more/books/</guid><description>Booklist A (mostly) up-to-date of books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read, are currently reading, or want to read.

British Columbia Greater Vancouver Oof, this one is tricky as I live in Metro Vancouver and been to so many restaurants. I will need to turn this list into a separate page, heh.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/about/</guid><description>About Within the con circuit My first experience working with panels was in 2016 while gofering for the big anime con in my city. I checked in panelists in my assigned room, observed and evaluated their panels, and fixed technical issues. I joined the con&amp;rsquo;s year-round team in Spring 2018 and became panel coordinator in Fall 2018.
After the Summer 2019 con, it was time to leave the year-round team and make my next move: run my own panels!</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>http://togarashimayo.com/credits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://togarashimayo.com/credits/</guid><description>Credits I plan and produce many of the things you see in the panel room, but I do need help sometimes!

We&amp;rsquo;d write a vision (or two) outlining what our future would look like, before writing some short-term SMART goals to hit before a certain timeframe (in the workplace&amp;rsquo;s case, every four months or a quarter). The visions would then be published on a company-wide spreadsheet where we&amp;rsquo;d be held accountable for them near the end of each quarter.</description></item></channel></rss>
