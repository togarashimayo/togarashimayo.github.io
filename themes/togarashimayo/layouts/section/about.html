    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>Within the con halls...</h2>

    <p>I have ran panels at anime cons since late 2019, where I currently specialize in video presentation panels. Before becoming a panelist of my own, I volunteered for the big anime convention in my city, where I specialized in panelist relations as part of the con's Programming department - be it moderating panel rooms as an at-con or screening panels as a year-round.</p>

    <p>Because of my past background, I can see panels from a staffer's perspective. I understand how conventions pick panels (including how they see specific types of panels), how to make the most out of my panelist coordinator, and what distingishes a "great" panel from a "good" panel (let alone, "blatantly only here for the badge" panels).</p>

    <p>I believe that educational panels shouldn't resemble a college lecture, let alone regurgitating Wikipedia. My approach to such panels is to be entertaining and engaging as possible (be it through video clips, trivia, jokes, and personal anecdotes). That way, they're enjoyable for those new to the subject matter, while the veterans gain a new perspective on concepts they're familiar with.</p>

    <p><quote>"A newcomer panel, an Otaku's Guide to Donghua, was a pleasant surprise. While there were some technical difficulties [involving a missing script], the panelist was knowledgeable and entertaining."</quote> - an r/Otakon user when prompted about "exceptional or fun" panels at Otakon 2022.</p>

    <h3>Tools of the trade:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Presentation software - Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
        <li>Video presentation software - 4K Video Downloader, OBS</li>
        <li>Graphic design - Figma and Waifu2x</li>
        <li>Research + Ideation - Notion (previously used OneNote)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>...and beyond</h2>

    <h3>Computers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I work as a (junior) full-stack software developer, with goals of both specializing further as a back-end developer and becoming an intermediate developer.</li>
        <li>I designed and wrote this website myself. It uses Hugo (including Go templating) for generating web pages, your good ol' CSS and Bootstrap for styling, Ionicons for the social media icons, and GitHub Actions to automatically deploy changes after submitting them to the codebase.</li>
        <li>I'm also interested in the local postsecondary student hackathon scene, where I've previously participated as an attendee at nwHacks and cmd-f.</li>
    </ul>

            
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Nothing's more like trying a new recipe or checking out a place to grab food or snacks. I didn't realize how much till my tenure at the big anime con I used to staff at; we sure like to eat around here!<p>
            
    <p>Some of my favourites in Metro Vancouver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yuu Tapas</li>
            <li>Mochido</li>
            <li>Wabukuro</li>
            <li>Vancouver Community College Cafeteria (I'm not joking; the people who “work” there are students studying for their chef certifications)</li>
            <li>Aiyaohno Cafe</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Language Learning</h3>            
        <p>I like to learn languages. Right now, I'm learning:</p>

        <!-- fuckin Microsoft and their inability to add flag emojis -->
        <ul>
            <li>&#x1F968 German (CEFR A2.1; schlager music and especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKSaAeyWCeM">this guy</a>)</li>
            <li>&#x1F950 French (CEFR A2.1; learned it in high school so might as well “use it or lose it”)</li>
            <li>&#x1F363 Japanese (pre-JLPT N5; because I enjoy the culture)</li>
            <li>&#x1F95F Mandarin (HSK1; so I can watch donghua without subtitles & communicate with older Chinese people)</li>
        </ul>

        My radar includes
        <ul>
            <li>&#x1F35D Italian (I love food!)</li>
            <li>&#x1F91F American Sign Language (to help accommodate hard-of-hearing people)</li>
            <li>&#x1F357 Tagalog (I have family on my mom's side who speaks the language)</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Best girl: Gawr Gura</li>
