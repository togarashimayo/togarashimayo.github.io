# Kioku (2024-10-19)

Kioku is the Korean-Japanese fusion place that replaced AKD Ramen.

Popped by the newly-opened Kioku Cafe + Dining (where AKD was). I tried their sushi sampler ($18; each sushi the cafe sells) and chose a grapefruit soda as my free "grand opening promo until Oct 31" drink. 

I enjoyed the sampler because of its variety. My favourites are the sweet egg inari and the salmon oshi. However, it's better as an appetizer or a light meal; I still felt a bit hungry after eating that set.

I agree with [ENW user] about how the grapefruit soda is BOMB. It's indeed refreshing and delicious, plus its light taste pairs well with the sushi. 

Service is wonderful, with the team proactively asking everyone for feedback on their food and service. The server is confident about her recommendations. And thanks to today's rain, I very much appreciate them letting me into the cafe 10 minutes before opening. That helped me warm and dry myself before ordering food.

They currently donâ€™t offer dessert. But if you're familiar with my activity here, you can guess where I went afterwards for that (plus my complimentary yet mandatory roasting) ðŸ¤£

Looking forward to trying their other items, specifically their udon pastas and rice bowls.
