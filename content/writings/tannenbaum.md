# The Tannenbaum

If you know me personally, follow me on social media, or attended the first few minutes of Anime in the Philippines at Sakura-Con 2024, you might know that I ~~stan~~ like this restaurant - [Keichoro's birthday dinner](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx9gKG0Lt9m/) did a good job at hyping me up for this restaurant, with the owner (hereafter Mira, the older lady often doing FOH stuff) working her magic to convert me into a repeat (and then a regular) customer after I showed up two months later.

Brought along my (half-German) anime convention friend Zerogouki to The Tannenbaum yesterday evening. He got the rouladen, I got my usual Wiener to the tune of Mira roasting me for not being "adventurous" as him, and we both got the Not Too Sweet™ Black Forest cakes.

Zerogouki found the rouladen delicious and authentic, and he'll definitely be back for the cheesecake. The *real* highlight of our visit, however, was watching Mira sprint out of the restaurant to successfully chase down another table who forgot their takeout. Bonus points for her making that chase while wearing wedge sandals; they seem hard to run in!

Better late than never, but I was at The Tannenbaum last Wednesday night. My go-to is a Wiener Schnitzel (this happens when you take r/SchnitzelVerbrechen too seriously that you associate sauce with barbarism) and a black forest cake, but I tried the vegetarian schnitzel as an omnivore considering that:
1. Mira encouraged me to do so during a previous post-meal chat.
2. I've been used to eating *tasty* vegan and vegetarian meals, thanks to my go-to in-office lunch spot (name in the comments) partially specializing in such meals.

I could only finish a third of that schnitzel before Mira checked up on me. I said that it's not my thing and I'd stick to my usual Wiener during future visits. She mentioned that the vegetarian schnitzel isn’t made with omnivores in mind, before insisting on replacing it with a Wiener. I got that Wiener minutes later, it hit the spot like during my previous visits (juicy pork and crisp breading), and I wasn't billed for that vegetarian schnitzel.

I didn’t photograph it, but I also ordered the black forest cake and it's what I’d expect based on previous visits: moist cake, good cream/cake ratio, and especially Not Too Sweet™ - I'm Asian; I'm obligated to say the last point!

(I later heard from Mira during our usual post-meal chat that she's indeed forgiving if you speak up about not liking your food for any reason. She'll note it, fix what she can, and life goes on. But if you tell her that your meal was “good” but later catches you saying otherwise online, it’s bad karma and she'll remember.)

### Notes

* The "go-to in-office lunch spot" is obviously Aiyaohno Cafe, knowing their pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan menu.
* Mira clarified during a future visit that she made that switch as a courtesy, considering that I'm one of her regular customers. She also acts as if the vegetarian schnitzel is the bane of my existence by mentioning it in front of guests who I bring in (such as, "Mich isn't ordering the vegetarian schnitzel" to my partner while I'm ordering).
