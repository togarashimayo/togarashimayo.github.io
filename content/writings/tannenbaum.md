# The Tannenbaum

## 2023-02-07

Better late than never, but I was at The Tannenbaum last Wednesday night. My go-to is a Wiener Schnitzel (this happens when you take r/SchnitzelVerbrechen too seriously that you associate sauce with barbarism) and a black forest cake, but I tried the vegetarian schnitzel as an omnivore considering that:
1. Mira encouraged me to do so during a previous post-meal chat.
2. I've been used to eating tasty vegan and vegetarian meals, thanks to my go-to in-office lunch spot (name in the comments) partially specializing in such meals.

I could only finish a third of that schnitzel before Mira checked up on me. I said that it's not my thing and I'd stick to my usual Wiener during future visits. She mentioned that the vegetarian schnitzel isn’t made with omnivores in mind, before insisting on replacing it with a Wiener. I got that Wiener minutes later, it hit the spot like during my previous visits (juicy pork and crisp breading), and I wasn't billed for that vegetarian schnitzel.

I didn’t photograph it, but I also ordered the black forest cake and it's what I’d expect based on previous visits: moist cake, good cream/cake ratio, and especially Not Too Sweet™ - I'm Asian; I'm obligated to say the last point!

(I later heard from Mira during our usual post-meal chat that she's indeed forgiving if you speak up about not liking your food for any reason. She'll note it, fix what she can, and life goes on. But if you tell her that your meal was “good” but later catches you saying otherwise online, it’s bad karma and she'll remember.)

*Mira later clarified in-person that she made that switch as a courtesy, considering that I'm one of her regular customers.*
