# Greens and Beans (2024-03-02)

Greens and Beans is a deli that is well-known among Eat New West members (let alone New West in general), because the owner (hereafter, "Leona") is both an active member and a community pillar.

We live in Vancouver, but my partner and I swung by Greens and Beans on our way to pick up our MunChi order (write-up on the way here!) - I've heard many good things about the deli from this group, especially their soup flights!

We ordered two soup flights to sample all six of today's choices (French onion, Thai red curry chicken, chicken noodle, minestrone, cream of tomato, clam chowder). We both enjoyed the French onion, but we didn't ask for cheese and croutons. For individual choices, my partner and I prefer the chicken noodle and clam chowder respectively.

While we didn't order sandwiches, we found the train delivery service adorable (including one kid having a field day over it). The weeb in me was also delighted to see folding chairs in the dining area - perfect for my Shinji posing tendencies.

Thanks again, Leona Green!
