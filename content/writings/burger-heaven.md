# Burger Heaven (2024-11-27)

Burger Heaven is a burger place known for its thicc burgers.

* *If you look at the Burger Heaven menu, the teriyaki burger has a line about how it's "Miss Piggy's Favourite" without providing context.*

Still better late than never, but I finally visited Burger Heaven for their burgers with $partner and Sheryl Laine last week (2024-11-19).

I picked a pickle-free #4 (teriyaki mozzarella, bacon, and mushroom) burger and ate it in one sitting.  Along with the titular ingredients, this burger also comes with lettuce, tomato, and onions in between a Kaiser roll.

The bun held up well especially with how juicy the burger is. It's so juicy that some of it got on my hands easily, where $partner and Sheryl watched me dash to the bathroom halfway into my burger! Meanwhile, the bacon is crispy, the veggies are fresh, and the button mushroom was nicely sautéed.

The wedges are crispy on the outside, but have a soft inside once you bite into one. We also got more of those wedges than we expected as the kitchen made too much!

Overall, this is an great take on a teriyaki burger and was thus worth my $24.49 (especially the size). But does anyone know why and how this is Miss Piggy’s favourite?

PS: If you ate at Tannenbaum on that day where you chatted with an Asian lady in a black hoodie near closing (specifically about your Schwarzwalder schnitzel liking), you met me! You did say you're semi-active in the group, hehe.
