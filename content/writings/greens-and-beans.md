# Greens and Beans

Greens and Beans is a deli that is well-known among Eat New West members (let alone New West in general), because the owner (hereafter, "Leona") is both an active member and a community pillar. One of the fun things I do each time I show up is to order a soup flight where I prioritize soups I haven't tried yet.

Dropped by Greens and Beans before heading to the anime art market in North Vancouver. This time, I tasted the:

* **Beef dip** - Generous amount of beef that pairs well with the crusty bread. I'd pay extra to add some green peppers, onions, and some cheese for a "cheesesteak" next time!
* **Chicken corn chowder** - I prefer thicker chowders, but this is one flavourful and hearty soup. It's also one of my first choices if Leona's lineup involves previously-tried soups. (Leona clarified that while her chowders are thick when making them, they quickly thin out in the warmer!)

Unfortunately, Leona sold all of her strawberry and butterscotch scones when I arrived. I got a cheese scone for $partner but felt that I should have at least tried the raisin scone (as I am already "adventurous" when it comes to Leona's soups). At least there are always more visits for trying such flavours!

* *My "vending friend" is obviously Jesse Betteridge, who had a table dedicated to used weeb stuff (including some Discotek Blu-Rays)*

Popped by Greens and Beans before a certain Fandom Bazaar yesterday. I got my usual shrimp-and-avo sandwich plus a soup flight with three soups I haven't tried yet.

* **Tomato with roasted garlic** - This was the favourite out of the three that I selected. It's very flavourful and has that parmesan taste, where I was surprised to learn that it contains absolutely no parmesan!
* **Chicken gumbo** - This soup was OK, as it's a bit sour to my liking.
* **(Beef) Chili** - I know it's a curb-stomp battle, but this slightly-spicy chili gives Tim Hortons a run for its money. The meat is generous yet tender and I like how there's a variety of legumes in it.

The cheddar scone (while not pictured) made a nice breakfast for today. And the service is lightning quick; I got my sandwich within a minute, while one of my vending friends who showed up during lunchtime echoed a similar sentiment.

Which soups have you tried at Greens and Beans? (Perhaps when I'm 4-5 visits in, I should make and post a Tiermaker chart here ranking all the soups I've had at the deli)

We live in Vancouver, but my partner and I swung by Greens and Beans on our way to pick up our MunChi order (write-up on the way here!) - I've heard many good things about the deli from this group, especially their soup flights!

We ordered two soup flights to sample all six of today's choices (French onion, Thai red curry chicken, chicken noodle, minestrone, cream of tomato, clam chowder). We both enjoyed the French onion, but we didn't ask for cheese and croutons. For individual choices, my partner and I prefer the chicken noodle and clam chowder respectively.

While we didn't order sandwiches, we found the train delivery service adorable (including one kid having a field day over it). The weeb in me was also delighted to see folding chairs in the dining area - perfect for my Shinji posing tendencies.

Thanks again, Leona Green!
