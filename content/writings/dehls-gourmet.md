# Dehl's Gourmet (2024-08-11)

Dehl's Gourmet is a African restaurant near the Quay.

* *Someone on ENW created a Facebook reel raving about Dehl's Gourmet, claiming that we should "keep scrolling" if our name isn't [ENW regular].*

My name obviously isn't [ENW regular], but [ENW user]'s reel made me pop by Dehl's Gourmet yesterday after lunch.

But unlike [ENW user], I went with the veggie patty instead of the beef patty. The patty does have the right amount of spice akin to a veggie samosa from a well-respected Indian place. It also has a hint of sweetness from the onion and corn, plus a flaky yet crispy pastry when warmed (be it at the restaurant or at home). Indeed a cheap eat worth its $6.

Service is wonderful. When I was unsure about what to get from the baked goods counter, the clerk confidently recommended me the patties. After I went with her recommendation, she also instructed me on how I can reheat one using an oven at home.

I want to return for more of those patties, along with the jollof rice , the puff puff, and the amazing AC.
