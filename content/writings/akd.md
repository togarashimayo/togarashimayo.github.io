# AKD Kitchen (2024-08-25)

AKD Kitchen was _the_ ramen spot in New Westminster. It was where I got my first taste of New West eats (courtesy of Jesse and his then-girlfriend, now wife) in 2020, way before Keichoro introduced me to Tannenbaum and I joined Eat New West.

Made it to AKD last Friday evening with $partner because of [ENW user]'s earlier AKD closure post here.

I usually pick a black (soy) Ajitama during past visits, but chose the red (miso) meat lover's ramen. If I currently don't have the bandwidth to travel to Langley, I should probably gorge myself on some extra meat during this visit.

This bowl has the rich broth, firm noodles, tender chashu, blanched veggies, and well-cooked egg I've been missing..and will miss dearly. The karaage was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the service is attentive despite the restaurant being _packed_.

New West was lucky to have AKD during its four years in the city!

(It was also jarring leaving the restaurant and seeing 30-40 people waiting outside in the rain. It also did not help that the restaurant stopped take-out orders.)
