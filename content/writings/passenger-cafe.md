# Passenger Cafe

I popped by Passenger Cafe yesterday before dinner and picked up a butter croissant ($4.95) that I enjoyed this morning.  

My opinions echo [ENW regular] from her late 2022 review (link in the comments) on how soft, airy, and well-balanced it is. However, I also like how the croissant breaks into satisfying flakes when biting into it. 

I'm more partial to Beaucoup, but this is a place I can see myself swinging by again to try their drinks and flavoured croissants!
