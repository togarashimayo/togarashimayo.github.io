# Panels

Here are the panels that I've ran at conventions since 2019, be it my own work or as an assistant/co-panelist on another panel. I also include this page in my panel applications, where I let it do the talking for my previous experience - you can only include so much information in a webform without that info resembling a wall of text!

Notes:
* All panels are 50-60 minutes by default.
* I need both a projector with HDMI support and speakers, as I rely on visuals (including clips) for my panels. An HDMI to USB-C adapter (in case mine borks), a chair, a table, and a water pitcher with cups are nice-to-haves.
* For panel coordinators (both current and prospective): My panels come with customization options and you can request a view-only copy of my previous work. If you would like something added, changed, or omitted within reason, please contact me before your intake's deadline.
* I want to make my panels the best they can be. Any constructive feedback (including questions, comments, and concerns) that you might have is appreciated - please email or message them to me!
