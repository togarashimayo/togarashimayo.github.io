# Panels

Here are all of the panels that I've ran at conventions, be it my own work or as an assistant through another panelist's work.

These panels require both a projector and speakers, as I rely on visuals and some funny clips to entertain your attendees. A HDMI to USB-C adapter (in case mine borks), a chair, a table, and a water pitcher are nice-to-haves.
