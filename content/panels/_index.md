# Panels

Here are the panels that I've ran at conventions since Fall 2019, be it my own work or as an assistant/co-panelist on another panel. I also include this page in my panel applications, where I let it do the talking for my previous experience - you can only include so much information in a webform without that info resembling a wall of text!

Notes:
* All panels are 50-60 minutes by default.
* I need a projector with HDMI support, a speaker system, a microphone with a stand, and access to a power outlet for my laptop - all of which should be present in a typical convention's panel room. 
* An HDMI to USB-C adapter (in case mine borks), an extra microphone with a stand (for a workaround in case the audio jack borks), a chair, a table, drinking water (such as water bottles or a water jug with cups) are nice to haves.
* For panel coordinators (both current and prospective): My panels come with customization options and you can request a view-only copy of my previous work. If you would like something added, changed, or omitted within reason, please contact me before you start sending out offer letters to accepted panelists.
* I want to make my panels the best they can be. Any constructive feedback (including questions, comments, and concerns) that you might have is appreciated - please email or message them to me!
