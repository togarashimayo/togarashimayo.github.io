# Writings

A list of my writings.

## Eat New West

Eat New West is a FB group dedicated to documenting people's food adventures in the titular city and in adjacent areas. I'm a member of the group as my hair salon is in New West, and I'd like to find more delicious eats beyond ramen and German food. It is also where I hone my food writing skills, by painting a picture of the places I've been to.

If you are a local food spot who is part of ENW, don't be afraid to send me an email asking me to drop by.
