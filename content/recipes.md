# Recipes

A list of my recipes mentioned in my panels. A massive thank you to [Kittea](https://bsky.app/profile/kittea.bsky.social) for her Tsukino-Con 2025 feedback about uploading these recipes (which I can turn into QR codes) + adding the corresponding QR codes to my panels.

If you ever make any of these recipes and share them on social media, please tag me! Bonus points if you modified any of the recipes, with those modificiations working super well for you. 

PS: I promise that they don't come with stories. I save them for my panel!
