# Little black book of panelists

From casual panelists to those who are also the panelist equivalent of Hunger Games careers, here are some of my favourite panelists whose programming I like to watch (...and e-watch) when I'm not creating or running my panels. 

I haven’t been to all these panelists’ panels. But for the ones I haven't been to, some of my contacts recommended them (including the corresponding panelist(s)) to me.
