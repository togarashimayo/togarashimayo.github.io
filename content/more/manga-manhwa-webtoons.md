# Manga, Manhwa, and Webtoons list

A collection of manga, manhwa, webtoons that I've read. Everything under "2023" and earlier are for English-only titles.

Kudos to:
* [Dr. Emily Hall](https://webtoongenius.com/) for putting print manhwa on my list, and for recommending *Abandoned Empress*, *Remarried Empress*, *Orange Marmalade*, and all of Carnby Kim's work.
* Rosa, [Orian](https://www.twitch.tv/orianhdx), Jaune, and Leo for sharing their interest in manhwa and webtoons with me.
* [Ki Cafe](https://order.ki-tea.com/) for their semi-public manga collection. This was a big help in helping me evaluate whether a manga is worth reading without having to twiddle my thumbs with the public libraries.
* The Vancouver Public Library for their public manga collection.
