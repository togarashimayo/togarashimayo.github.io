# Recommended food places

AKA my "little navy book" - my favourite places to go to, be it locally or abroad (and especially during cons for the latter)

## British Columbia

### Greater Vancouver

"Hey Mich, I want your recommendations but I'm not interested in specifics."

* Aiyaohno Cafe ("Aiyaohno") - Japanese-inspired pastries, drinks, and "404 meat not found" meals ran by a lovely husband-wife duo (Bev and Greg).
    * This is my favourite cafe (let alone, place for food in general), because Bev and Greg aren't afraid to use their kitchen as a playground to bring their ideas to life _and_ make those ideas tasty - my favourites are the (iced) royal milk tea, the teriyaki "chicken", and the now-retired "hambagu" donburi.
    * I like how Bev can/will easily build a rapport with her customers, where I've had the chance to know about her and Greg's adventures beyond (and before starting) the cafe.
    * This is where I get my shortbread cookies for when I head to out-of-BC conventions (starting with Otakon 2023, where I dropped one to the con's programming director)
* The Tannenbaum ("Tannenbaum"; vielen Dank [Keichoro](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx9gKG0Lt9m/?img_index=1)!) - Homestyle German fare with the most extreme customer service I've seen in my life going to restaurants.
* Petite Bao - An Asian twist on your usual hamburgers (bao burger buns). Love their char siu bao burgers.
* AKD Ramen (thank you [Jesse](https://linktr.ee/jbetteridge)!) - Local non-chain ramen whose miso "ajitama" ramen hits the spot. 
    * This place was my original post-haircut lunch spot (as my salon is also in DT New West) before Tannenbaum 1HKO'd it out of that spot, but wouldn't mind returning back to meet up with someone. 
* Mello - Compared to Lee's, I like the texture (soft brioche!) and flavours more. They're also satisfying to have during a train ride to Seattle for Sakura-Con.

(Giving a honourable mention to Notch8's brunch buffet. It's your typical upscale brunch buffet so you know what to expect. But my mom's side of the family and I are huge fans of both Raluca and Adrian; they're super entertaining and Notch8 is lucky to have them as servers!)


### Victoria

* The Bubble Tea Place (thank you Tsukino-Con Programming) - This is a textbook example of how you don't need to have Asian owners to successfully sell bubble tea. The pearls have the right chew and I like how they disregard authenticity where they turn to cocktails for their lineup's inspiration.

### Sunshine Coast

* Coastal Crust Pizza (thank you Jarvis!)

## North America

### Seattle

* Salt & Straw
* FOB Poke Bar (thanks [Emily](https://webtoongenius.com/)!)
* Maneki
* Beanfish
* Momiji (thanks Lee!)

### Toronto

* COPS Donuts (thank you Chloe!)
* Craig's Cookies

### Baltimore

* Mera - Middle Eastern and Mexican fare that hits the spot after a long flight to the city.
* Ice Queens - Black-women-owned snowball place with friendly and chatty service.
* Ramen Utsuke

### Washington DC

* Prost! - German food a couple blocks away from the Otakon venue. The chicken schnitzel benny (as much as it's a crime itself) is solid.
* Reren Lamen (thank you AniTwitter!)
* Ben's Chili Bowl (thank you [Mike](https://twitter.com/MichaelToole/status/1552428310067662850)!)
* Captain Cookie and the Milkman

## Asia

### Philippines

#### Metro Manila

* The UCC cafes (specifically Clockwork at Ayala Vertis North)
* Bizu (high tea)

#### Metro Cebu

* Ginza
