# Visions and goals

My former workplace has a self-improvement program called "Visions and goals". We'd write a vision (or two) outlining what our future would look like, before writing some short-term SMART goals to hit before a certain timeframe (in the workplace's case, every four months or a quarter). The visions would then be published on a company-wide spreadsheet where we'd be held accountable for them near the end of each quarter.

I liked it enough that I also applied the program's principles to my convention life, although my way of staying accountable is by publishing my visions (and goals) on my public-facing sites and profiles.
