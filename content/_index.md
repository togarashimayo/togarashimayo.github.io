Hello, I'm **[Mich Chan](/about)** (she/her & they/them). I create and run **[fandom panels such as *Anime in the Philippines*, *An Otaku's Guide to Donghua*, and the *Food of Spy x Family* series](/panels)** that have been enjoyed by hundreds of attendees in Canada (BC, ON, QC) and the US (WA, DC). And I'm serious about creating entertaining work for everyone.
