# Roast "basilisk" (Episode 2)

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs whole chicken
* 1 white, yellow, or sweet onion
* 1 small lemon or 1/2 lemon
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp Herb seasoning
* 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
* Salt and pepper

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Cut onion into large chunks.
3. Crush the garlic.
4. Halve the lemon 
5. Mix the herb seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Rub that mixture on your chicken and especially on all the parts. 
6. Squeeze one lemon half on the chicken.
7. Stuff chicken with the onion, garlic, used lemon peel, and rosemary.
8. Bake chicken for 60-90 minutes, legs facing the back of the oven.
9. Remove chicken from the heat and let rest from 20 minutes.

## Notes
* Use the leftover pan drippings to make a pan gravy.
* You can still use the stuffing and bone after enjoying the chicken! My younger sister took both of them to make a hot and sour soup for my mom.
