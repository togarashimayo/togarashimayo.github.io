## "Man-eating plant" tart (Episode 1)

*Filling adapted from [Vegan Huggs' quiche recipe](https://veganhuggs.com/easy-vegan-quiche/). Massive thank you to the Tsukino-Con attendee who suggested that I use green cherry tomatoes instead of grapes*

## Ingredients (enough for a small skillet)

### Crust

* 4-5 medium red peppers

### Filling
* 6 small yellow potatoes
* 350g package extra firm tofu, [drained](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-drain-tofu)
* 1/2 tsp turmeric
* 1/2 - 1 tsp black salt (kala namak)
* 2 tbsp all purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 3/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp lobster base
* few shakes of white pepper
* 1-2 tbsp water
* 7-12 halved cherry tomatoes (red, orange, green)

## Steps

### Crust

1. Preheat oven to 550 degrees.
2. Core, halve, and tray the peppers face-side up.
3. Add salt to the peppers and leave for 30 minutes. This draws some moisture out of them.
4. Rinse the peppers and pat dry with a paper towel. Turn them around face-side down on a baking tray. 
5. Bake for 20 minutes. You'll notice that the skin will look burned. This is normal.
6. Transfer peppers to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Steam for 20 minutes.
7. Peel the peppers.
8. Pound the peppers with a rolling pin (or even better, a meat hammer) in between two paper towels.
9. Arrange the red peppers in a small skillet so it creates a crust. Start with the "floor" and then create the "walls".

### Filling
1. Cut potatoes into 1 inch cubes. Bake for 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees. If you like, you can toss them in some olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. Combine the tofu, turmeric, black salt, starch, onion powder, garlic powder, lobster base, and water in a food processor till smooth. This will be very thick; add a tablespoon of extra water or plant milk to thin it out.
3. Add the potatoes to the floor of the red pepper pie crust.
4. Pour (...or press) in the custard. Top with the tomatoes.
5. Bake for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.
6. Remove tart from the oven and let cool. 

## Notes
* This recipe was last overhauled on August 2 2025. The previous version used a twice-baked red pepper crust, less seasoning, soft tofu instead of firm tofu for the filling, and green grapes as the topping.
* Taste the filling after you blend the tofu with the seasonings.
* For an all-vegan version, replace the lobster broth with 1/2 tsp soy sauce.
