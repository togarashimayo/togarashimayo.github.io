# "Mandrake" and "basilisk" omelette (Episode 2)

*This is an approximation; I did not use a specific recipe when making this omelette filling*

## Ingredients (2 servings)
* ~180g piece(s) pork belly or bacon
* 1/4 large daikon
* 4 eggs
* salt and pepper
* 1 tbsp sugar
* couple shakes of salt
* few grinds of pepper
* 1 tbsp neutral flavoured oil

## Steps

### Filling
1. Combine sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub on the pork belly.
2. Cut daikon into 1 cm cubes.
3. In a frying pan on medium heat, sear the seasoned pork on both sides. Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes. **Do not wash the pan**.
4. Cut pork into 1 cm pieces.
5. In the same frying pan that you used to cook the pork belly, fry the daikon until golden brown.
6. Add the pork and stir until the pork is fully cooked.
7. Remove from the heat and spoon the filling on individual plates.

### Omelette
*I am not the best person at cooking omelettes.*
1. Beat eggs; add salt and pepper to taste.
2. In a non-stick pan, heat 1 tbsp of neutral-flavoured oil on medium-low heat.
3. Pour in half of the egg mixture, and tilt the pan till the egg covers the surface. 
4. Remove from the heat and place above the filling mixture.
