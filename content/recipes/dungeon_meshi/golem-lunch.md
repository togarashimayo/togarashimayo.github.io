# Delicious in Dungeon (Episode 4) - Golem field fresh veggie lunch

## Whole stewed cabbage

### Ingredients
- 1 small head green cabbage
- 7-8 strips of pork belly or bacon
- 2 medium onions
- 1 large carrot
- 4-6 small yellow potatoes
- 1 tbsp neutral flavoured oil
- 4-6 cups vegetable stock
- 4 cloves minced garlic
- Bay leaf

### Steps

1. Decore and halve the cabbage.
2. Cut the carrot into 1/2 inch coins.
3. In a large pot on medium heat, heat 1 tbsp neutral flavoured oil. Once heated, sear the bacon or pork belly. Drain on a paper towel.
4. Drain the pot until you have 2 tbsp of fat left. Add onion and a splash of water and use a spatula to scrape up the browned bits. Cook those onions until transparent.
5. Add the carrot and garlic and cook until you can smell the garlic.
6. Add the stock, bay leaf, seared meat, stock, and cabbage halves. Bring to a boil. 
7. Once boiled, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot with a lid, and cook for 60-90 minutes.
8. Remove the solids from the soup as it's needed for blanching the salad veggies.
9. Plate the soup and the solida as if they're from the show.

## Turnip salad

### Ingredients (serves 1)
- 1 small white turnip or parsnip
- 1 small carrot with greens
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt to taste

### Steps
1. Cut turnip into thinly-sliced medallions.
2. Remove the greens from the carrot. Wash that well.
3. Cut carrot into very fine matchsticks.
4. Blanch the turnip, carrot, and carrot greens in the broth for 2 minutes each.
5. Toss veggies, olive oil, and salt in a small bowl.

## Notes
* I got a slab of pork belly from T&T and cut that into strips with a sharp knife.
* This recipe got a major overhaul on July 31 2025 as part of Otakuthon 2025 prep, so it resembles its in-show counterpart more. The previous version was based on an Irish cabbage stew, with the salad veggies being raw.
