# Pokeblocks (Pokemon Ruby / Sapphire / Emerald)

*Adapted from [Sugar Geek Show's Kohakutou recipe](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/kohakutou-crystal-gummy-candy/). Assumes that you are only making one colour*

## Ingredients

* 360 mL cool water
* 14g agar-agar
* 680g white sugar
* 1/4 tsp flavouring (optional)
* few drops of your favourite food colouring

## Steps
1. Lightly oil a heatproof glass dish.
2. In a medium saucepan, add water.
3. Add agar agar and let sit for 5 minutes.
4. Add in the sugar and bring the saucepan to a boil on medium heat. Keep stirring until you see small bubbles (simmering)
5. Remove saucepan from the heat. Stir in the flavouring and colour.
6. Pour mixture into the oiled glass dish. It should be 1" thick and you might have to use multiple glass containers.
7. Chill for 2-3 hours.
8. Remove set jelly from the glass.
9. Cut into 1" blocks using a sharp knife.
10. Place the gummies on a parchment covered surface and let dry for 2-3 days.


## Notes
* I used lemon as my flavour.
* I used the golden cup agar agar, but I have heard amazing things about the telephone brand.
* I also cut off the edges so they look sharp.
* If you are short on time, you could also dust the candy in powdered sugar for a Turkish delight inspired treat.
