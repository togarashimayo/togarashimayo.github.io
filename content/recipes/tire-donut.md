# Tire donut w/ strawberry glaze (Mario Kart World for Switch 2)

*Recipe modified from [Sally's Baking Addiction's glazed donut recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-make-homemade-glazed-doughnuts/) using feedback from both [Bev Tsang](https://aiyaohno.com) and [Keichoro](https://www.instagram.com/keichoro03/)*

## Ingredients

### Yeast donut

* 240 mL warmed whole milk
* 7g active dry yeast
* 65g granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 85g unsalted melted butter
* 5mL vanilla extract
* 2.5 mL ground nutmeg
* 2.5 mL salt
* 500g all-purpose flour
* at least 750 mL of preferably unused cooking oil

### Strawberry glaze

* 17 grams dehydrated strawberries
* 40 mL whole milk
* 103 grams powdered sugar

### Stripe icing

* 50 grams powdered sugar
* At least 5 mL milk
* dash of vanilla extract

## Steps

### Donut

1. Mix milk, yeast, and 15 mL sugar in a large bowl. Let sit for 15 minutes.
2. Add the remaining sugar, eggs, butter, vanilla, nutmeg, salt, and 250g flour. Mix the dough with a wooden spoon or large silicone spatula until combined.
3. Add the remaining 250g flour and mix until the dough pulls away from the bowl.
4. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for 5-7 minutes. The dough should be smooth and a bit sticky (highly recommend doing [the windowpane test](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-the-windowpane-test-for-bread-dough) to assess doneness). Do not overknead; otherwise you will get dense and tough donuts!
5. Once kneaded, transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and lightly cover the dough with some of the oil in the greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 90-120 minutes.
6. Punch the dough to remove the air, transfer to another lightly floured surface, and roll the dough to a thickness between 3/4" to 1".
7. Cut donut rounds out of the dough. Transfer to a sheet pan, cover with a plastic wrap, and let it rise for about 30 minutes.
8. Heat a medium to large saucepan containing at least 3/4" of oil until it's 375 degrees. Don't skimp on the oil unless you want your donuts' sides to look like Alysa Liu's halo hair.
9. Add 2-3 donuts at a time and cook each side for one minute. Remove each with a metal slotted spoon, a metal slotted spatula, or a heat resistant pair of tongs, before placing on a wire rack. Repeat for the other rounds.

### Glaze
1. In a food processor, grind the dehydrated strawberries into a powder.
2. In a small bowl, combine the milk, strawberries, and icing sugar.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap until you're ready to start glazing the donuts.

## Vanilla icing
Combine the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla in a small disposable sandwich bag. Cut a small tip in one of the corners to use as a mock piping bag.

## Assembly
1. Spin each warm donut in the glaze.
2. Place the donut back on the rack. 
3. Drizzle some stripes on the glazed donut.
4. Let the donut set for at least 20 minutes.

## 
* I've found that dehydrated strawberries are the cheapest from an Asian grocery store. 
* If you don't have a food thermometer, you can also use a wooden chopstick to check temperature. Dip the tip in the oil to check whether it slowly bubbles (the oil is hot enough if so).
* I used a biscuit cutter to cut the rounds and an icing coupler to cut the rounds. This might be easier if you have a donut cutter. 
* For the rounds, add 5-6 donuts at a time and cook each side for 30 seconds.
* I like to place plastic wrap underneath the racks for easy cleanup.
