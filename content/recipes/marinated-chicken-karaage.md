# Marinated chicken / karaage (*The Summer Hikaru Died, Summer 2025*)

*Recipe adapted from [Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook's chicken karaage recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/karaage/)*.

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs chicken breasts or thighs
* 2 cloves crushed garlic
* 1 tsp grated ginger
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp sake
* 2 tsp Japanese soy sauce
* 3 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 3 tbsp corn, potato, or tapioca starch
* ~ 1 cup neutral-tasting oil
* 1 tsp salt
* Enough pepper to taste

## Steps

### Marinated chicken
1. Cut your chicken into 2 inch sized pieces. Transfer to a metal tray or a large bowl.
2. Toss chicken in the salt, pepper, ginger, and garlic.
3. Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, and sake in a small bowl, before pouring over the chicken. Mix, cover, and leave in the fridge for at least 60 min.

### Breading and frying the chicken
1. Set up a breading station where one tray has both a pile of all-purpose flour and a pile of your choice starch, an empty tray to store chicken, and a wok or frying pan with about 1/2-1 cup of oil heated to medium heat.
2. Dredge each piece of chicken in the flour and then in the starch, before placing it in the empty tray. Repeat for all chicken.
3. Cook 3-5 pieces at a time, where you cook each piece for 45 seconds per side. Transfer the chicken to a wire rack and repeat with the other chicken.
4. Raise the oil temperature to medium-high heat and fry the chicken again on each side for 20 seconds. Return to the wire rack and repeat with the other pieces.
5. Raise the oil temperature to high and fry the chicken again on each side for 20 seconds. Return to the wire rack and repeat with the other pieces. 

## Notes
* I made this recipe with tapioca starch.
