# Yakisoba burger (S3E42)

Yakisoba recipe adapted from [Namiko Chan of Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/yakisoba/).

## Ingredients (makes three burgers and plenty of yakisoba on the side)
* 1/2 onion (150g)
* 1 carrot (130g)
* 1/4 green cabbage (250-275g)
* 1 package of yakisoba or shanghai noodles cooked to package instructions
* At least 340 grams of uncut pork belly
* 2 tsp neutral oil
* freshly ground pepper to taste
* Japanese mayo to taste
* 60 mL worcestershire sauce
* 20 mL ketchup
* 20 mL oyster sauce
* 10 mL soy sauce
* 10 mL sugar
* At least 3 leaves lettuce
* Three horizontally-sliced hamburger buns

## Steps

### Prep
1. Core, quarter, and cut cabbage into bite-sized pieces.
2. Cut carrot into 2" slabs and cut into 2" long strips
3. Cut onion into thin (1/4") strips.
4. Cook noodles to package instructions
5. Slice half of the pork belly into six pieces that are 1/4" thick. Cut the other half of the pork belly into bite-sized pieces. This might be easier to cut if frozen. 
6. In a small bowl, combine worcestershire sauce, ketchup, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar in a bowl to make a sauce.

### Pork belly + yakisoba
1. In a large non-stick pan, griddle, or wok, heat 1 tsp of neutral oil on medium heat. 
2. When the surface is hot, add both the pork belly strips and pieces.
3. For the strips, cook on one side for 3-5 minutes until the surface is seared. Flip over and cook for another 3-5 minutes. Both sides should be seared and not pink. Remove from the heat.
4. Meanwhile, stir fry the bite-sized pork belly pieces until they are no longer pink.
5. Add the onion, and stir fry for 1-2 minutes while separating the layers.
6. Add the carrot and stir fry for 1-2 minutes.
7. Add the cabbage and stir fry until tender.
8. Place the cooked noodles on top of the protein and veggies. Try to loosen the noodles with chopsticks or tongs if you haven't done so yet.
9. Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss to combine.

### Assembly
1. Place burger bottom on a plate.
2. Tear a lettuce leaf and add to the burger bottom.
3. Spoon cooked yakisoba on the lettuce leaf.
4. Top yakisoba with two pieces of cooked pork belly
5. Spread mayo on the burger top.
6. Place burger bun on the burger.

## Notes
* Use green leaf lettuce for the most show-accurate look. (I personally don't like green leaf lettuce and would rather subsitute it for spring greens)
* For the burger bun, I used [King Arthur Baking's kaiser roll recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/kaiser-rolls-recipe) where I didn't stamp the bread and I sprinkled sesame seeds on the bun after dipping it in milk. You can use any sesame seed bun for this recipe.
