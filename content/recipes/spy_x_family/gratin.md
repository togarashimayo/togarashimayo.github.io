# Spy x Family (Season 1) - Camilla's gratin

*This is based on a macaroni and cheese recipe that I learned in high school.*

## Ingredients

* 300g ringed pasta (do not use macaroni)
* 100-125g prosciutto or speck
* 200-300g steamed broccoli
* 2 tbsp flour
* 28g (2 tbsp) butter or neutral tasting oil
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 250 mL milk
* 160g grated Emmental cheese (gyuere also works)
* 175g cooked shrimp

## Steps

1. Cut the broccoli in to small florets and [steam](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/steamed_broccoli/). 
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 x 13.5 " pan with butter or oil.
3. Boil your pasta according to package instructions and drain.
4. Heat the fat on low-medium heat in a medium saucepan. Once heated and render your prosciutto. Remove the meat from the pan. 
5. Add the flour to the saucepan, stir, and cook until golden brown (roux).
6. Add salt and pepper to the roux, before gradually stirring in the milk.
7. Turn off the heat and stir in the cheese until melted.
8. Add the broccoli and half of the meat and stir until combined.
9. Pour the mixture into the greased pan. Top with shrimp and the remaining meat. 
10. Bake for 10-15 min at 350 degrees.

## Notes

* If you'd like a saucier version like in the TV show, double the flour, butter, and milk for this recipe. You might want to use a cheaper white cheese if so, as the cheese won't be your dish's main highlight.
* If you cannot eat pork, you can sub the prosciutto for another "bacon" alternative. You know your options better than I do!
