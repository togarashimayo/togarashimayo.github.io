## Notes
* I used [Chasing the Donkey's ajvar recipe](https://www.chasingthedonkey.com/how-to-make-ajvar-recipe-roasted-red-pepper-sauce-recipe/), although you can buy jarred ajvar in a grocery store.
* I used [The Mediterranean Dish's pita chips recipe](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/homemade-pita-chips/)
* This recipe was last overhauled on August 3 2025 to use fewer marinade for the tomatoes and salmon.
