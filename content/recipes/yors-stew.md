# Spy x Family - Yor's stew (S1E14)

*Adapted from Luisa Weiss's Wiener Gulasch recipe from [Classic German Cooking](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/716001/classic-german-cooking-by-luisa-weiss/). Massive thank-you to Mira M for conceiving some of the modifications that I've implemented, and [Sam from Otakuthon](https://old.reddit.com/user/LoadingRevived) and his sister for [making this recipe + letting us know how it went](https://old.reddit.com/r/SpyxFamily/comments/1n01o4m/i_tried_making_yors_stew_from_spy_x_family_thanks/?share_id=Bxn3ezQC6Sx7zCoNhHxCm).*

I've included two different methods to make this.

## Ingredients
* 1kg stewing beef
* 350 mL water
* 1 tbsp baking soda
* 1kg onion
* 60 mL neutral flavoured oil
* 1 large carrot
* 3 cloves garlic
* 3 tbsp “sweet” paprika
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tsp marjoram or 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp caraway seeds (crushed)
* 2 cups beef broth or bouillon
* 1 tbsp corn starch, potato starch, or rice flour
* Sour cream to taste (optional)

## Steps

### Prep
1. Combine baking soda and water before pouring over the beef in a large bowl. Stir that before marinating in the fridge for 45 min. This is called "velvetting".
2. Dice the onions into 1/8/ - 1/4 inch pieces.
3. Mince the garlic.
4. Peel and [cut the carrots into rolling wedges](https://www.justonecookbook.com/rangiri/).

### Stovetop

1. Add oil to a medium-sized pot. When the oil heats, sautee onions for 5 min on med-high heat until transparent.
2. Add minced garlic and salt before sautéing for another 5 min. Reduce the heat to low.
3. Add paprika and stir for 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and stir well. Add majoram/oregano and caraway and stir for another while.
4. Drain, rinse, and pat the beef dry. Add to the pot and stir well.
5. Pour in the beef broth, stir well, and raise the heat from high. (If you are lazy like I am, you can add the beef bouillon cube and water to the pot and stir well).
6. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 2-3 hours while stiring occasionally. 

### Pressure cooker

*These instructions assume that you own an Instant Pot like I do. It might be different if you have a different brand*

1. Press the sear/saute button on your pressure cooker. When the inner pot is hot, add in the oil.
2. Sautee onions until transparent.
3. Add garlic and salt before sautéing for another 5 min.
4. Add paprika and stir for 30 seconds. Add the tomato paste and stir well. Add majoram/oregano and caraway and stir for another while.
5. Drain, rinse, and pat the beef dry. Add to the pot and stir well.
6. Pour in the beef broth and stir well. (If you are lazy like I am, you can add the beef bouillon cube and water to the pot and stir well).
7. Cover and lock the lid. Set the pressure level to high and cook for 45-60 minutes.
8. Let the pressure release naturally for 30 minutes. If the valve hasn't dropped yet, move the pressure release valve to "venting".

### Serving the stew (both stovetop and pressure cooker)

1. Thicken the gravy by adding your starch in a small bowl. Add 3 tbsp of the stew gravy into that bowl and mix until well-combined.
2. Mix the slurry back into the pot. If cooking the stew on a stove, remove the pot from the heat. If using sour cream, add it here.
3. Serve each dish with [a whole boiled potato](https://www.food.com/recipe/easy-unique-way-to-boil-and-peel-potatoes-397499) or potato chunks, [a fried egg](https://www.seriouseats.com/crispy-fried-eggs-recipe), and [sausage octopi](https://www.justonecookbook.com/cute-octopus-sausage-bento/) (if using them).

## Notes
* If you have a pestle and motar, crush the caraway seeds with that. Otherwise, use a rolling pin and a sandwich bag.
* Camilla mentions that people in Yor's home region _might_ add sour cream to their stew. I didn't add it to to the initial batch, but I did add it to an individual serving the next day. It makes the stew taste slightly creamy without the sour taste.
* Luisa's original recipe uses corn starch. I used potato starch in my first three attempts. Use rice flour if you want a more matte finish.
* Don't add the sour cream if you plan on freezing the batch. Otherwise the mixture will curdle. 
* I prefer to roast the potato chunks in olive oil for 15-20 minutes 450 degrees. I've found that the texture is better, combined with how the chunks look more attractive in the stew compared to using a whole potato.
* I haven't tested this yet, but [u/WYSE_Bookworm adapted this recipe so it works in a slow cooker](https://old.reddit.com/r/SpyxFamily/comments/1n01o4m/i_tried_making_yors_stew_from_spy_x_family_thanks/ns0kpow/?context=2).
