# "Mandrake" and "basilisk" omelette (Episode 2)

*This is an approximation; I did not use a specific recipe when making this omelette filling.*

## Ingredients (one giant omelette)
* ~180g piece(s) pork belly or cooked chicken meat
* 1/4 large daikon
* 3 eggs
* salt and pepper
* couple shakes of salt
* few grinds of black pepper
* white pepper (to taste)
* 1 tbsp neutral flavoured oil

## Steps

### Daikon
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
2. Cut daikon into 1 cm cubes.
3. Transfer to a bowl and toss in some olive oil, salt, and black pepper.
4. Tray on a parchment-lined baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes.

### Pork belly (if using)
1. Cube pork belly into bite-sized pieces.
2. Transfer into a bowl and toss in some olive oil, salt, black pepper, and white pepper to taste.
3. In a frying pan on medium heat, add oil.
4. When oil is hot enough, add the pork belly and keep stir-frying until all sides are seared.
5. Transfer to a paper towel lined bowl. 

### Omelette
*I am not the best person at cooking omelettes.*
1. Beat eggs; add salt and pepper to taste.
2. In a non-stick pan, heat 1 tbsp of neutral-flavoured oil on medium-low heat.
3. Pour in half of the egg mixture, and tilt the pan till the egg covers the surface. Keep using a rubber spatula to pull the egg away from the edges, while tilting the pan so more uncooked egg can flow under the spot you're pulling away from.
4. When the egg is close to being cooked, flip the omelette. If you'd like some help, slide the omelette on a plate cooked-side down, before flipping the plate on the pan so the uncooked side lands.
5. Spoon some of the daikon and meat on one half of the omelette. 
6. Transfer to a plate.
7. Cut the omelette in half and serve!

## Notes
* To give the illusion that the omelette is overflowing like in the show picture, you can add extra daikon and pork belly in between the cut sides. 
* Aya, my Anime North 2025 co-panelist made this dish with chicken meat instead of pork belly. (If I was her, I would use Costco rotisserie chicken)
* This recipe was last updated on July 30 2025 to use sauteed pork belly bites, roasted daikon, and a folded omelette. The previous recipe used pan-fried daikon, bite-sized pork belly chunks from a sugar rubbed pork belly, and an omelette on top of the filling.
