# Okonoimiyaki (*Ranma 1/2's 2024 remake*, Fall 2024)

*Recipe adapted from [Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/okonomiyaki/)*.

## Ingredients
* 125g all-purpose flour
* 1.25 mL salt
* 1.25 mL sugar
* 2.5 mL baking powder
* 160 mL dashi
* 1/2 head napa cabbage
* 4 large eggs
* 1/4 cup crushed prawn or lobster chips

## Instructions

1. Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Mix in the dashi and let rest for at least two hours.
2. Core and finely chop the napa cabbage.
3. After the batter is rested, add in the eggs and crushed chips. Gradually fold in the finely chopped cabbage into thirds. Mix well before each addition. You might not need to use all of the cabbage.
4. Heat up a large non-stick pan with a little neutral oil on medium heat. Once heated, add a portion of batter and spread/shape that batter into a 6 inch circle.
5. Cook covered on medium-low heat for 5 minutes or until the bottom side is nicely browned.
6. Flip over and cook for another 5 minutes.
7. Uncover and cook for 2 minutes.
8. Transfer the okonomiyaki to an individual plate, and cook the rest of the batter.
9. Garnish with okonomiyaki (...or takoyaki or tonkatsu sauce), Japanese mayo, dried bonito flakes, and seaweed.

## Notes
* I wrote this recipe to help finish some leftover napa cabbage from making [crab nabe](./crab-nabe) and lobster chips one of my taste testers gifted me. If you have regular cabbage and tempura scraps, I strongly recommend following Namiko's OG recipe to a T.
