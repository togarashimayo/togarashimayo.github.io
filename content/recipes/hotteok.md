# Cat hotteok (*KPop Demon Hunters*, Summer 2025)

*Adapted from [Maangchi's recipe](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/hotteok)*

## Ingredients

### Dough
* 240 mL milk
* 30 mL white sugar
* 10 mL dry yeast
* 2.5 mL salt
* 15 mL neutral oil
* 2.5 mL vanilla extract (optional)
* 312g all-purpose flour

### Brown sugar filling
* 100g brown sugar
* 5 mL cinnamon
* 30 mL walnut filling

(Can use other fillings instead, such as Nutella)

### Cat design

Either melt 15 mL of chocolate chips and fill a plastic sandwich/piping bag with it, or use edible markers.

## Steps

### Making the dough
1. Microwave the milk for 30 seconds.
2. Combine milk, white sugar, yeast, salt, oil, and vanilla extract (if using) in a large bowl.
3. Add in 250g of flour and stir until it creates a sticky dough.
4. Cover with a plastic wrap and let rise for an hour.
5. Punch the dough to remove air bubbles and let rise again for 10-20 seconds.
6. Add 62g flour to the bowl, knead the dough into the flour, and divide into 8 equal portions (I use a scale)

### Making the traditional filling

Combine sugar, cinnamon, and walnuts.

### Shaping the hotteok

For each pancake...
1. Flatten each dough ball into a circle.
2. Add in half a teaspoon of the filling.
3. Gather the edges together and twist around to seal.

### Cooking it

1. In a non-stick pan over medium heat, heat up to 1 tsp of neutral oil.
2. When hot, place a dough ball and let cook for 30 seconds.
3. Flip and push the dough to create a circle about the size of a CD.
4. Cook for a minute until golden brown.
5. Turn the dough after 30 seconds and cook again for a minute.
6. Turn the dough again and set the temperature to low/minimum, to melt the sugar inside the pancake into a syrup.

## Final touches

1. Using a piping bag of chocolate, draw the cat ears.
2. Draw the rest of the cat head. 
3. Draw the eyes and the nose.
4. Draw the outline for the mouth and fill that outline up with with chocolate. 
5. Serve hot. You can reheat the pancake using a microwave for 10-20 second intervals.
