# Focaccia

*For [@muffinpoots.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/muffinpoots.bsky.social), as they asked me to "get the focaccia to them" when [posting my pic of it](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:iigcc7kmuylkxcfnarhzckav/post/3lxsd2xb2gk2p).*

## Ingredients (for one 13" x 18" sheet pan)
* 454g all-purpose flour (can use half AP flour and half high-gluten flour instead)
* 7.5mL oregano
* 3.75mL rosemary
* 1.25mL thyme
* 9g instant yeast
* 7g table salt
* 3.5g sugar
* 300 mL warm water
* 49g olive oil (35g for the dough, 14 mL for the coating)
* 3.75 mL coarse salt (optional)

## Steps

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, dried herbs, yeast, salt, and sugar until combined.
2. Add in the warm water and olive oil (35 mL) and stir until combined.
3. Either add flour to the bottom of your mixing bowl OR a clean surface (such as a large cutting board or a smooth countertop). Knead until it passes [the windowpane test](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-the-windowpane-test-for-bread-dough).
3. Cover the dough (or the bowl) with plastic wrap, and let rise for 15-20 minutes.
4. While the dough is resting, lightly oil your bake tray (be it using cooking spray or coating the entire surface) including the edges. Sprinkle all-purpose flour over the bake tray's surface.
5. Once the dough is rested, punch the excess air out of the dough. This removes the big air pockets formed during baking.
6. Form the dough into a rectangle that resembles your bake tray's shape. Place the dough on the tray and spread it all the way to each edge. You can use either your hands or a rolling pin.
7. Use a fork to poke holes on the dough's surface, which also removes bigger air pockets.
8. Pour 14 mL on the dough's surface, covering its nooks and crannies. Sprinkle the coarse salt on the dough if using them.
9. Lightly cover the bake tray with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 30-45 minutes.
10. Preheat the oven to 350F.
11. Remove the plastic wrap and bake for 15-30 minutes.
12. Transfer the bread to a wire rack and let cool. Cut with a bread knife and enjoy!
