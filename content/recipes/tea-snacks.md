# Tea snacks / sweets

## Ingredients

At least 1/2 portions of chilled [strawberry, matcha, cinnamon, and lemon shortbread](./shortbread.md)

## Steps

1. Thaw all four shortbread flavours for about 20 minutes.
2. Using a scale, portion each dough into 3-5 gram pieces. Shape each dough piece into a ball.
3. Place dough balls on a parchment lined baking sheet and freeze for 30 minutes.
4. Bake for 8-10 minutes at 325 degrees.
5. Let cool on the baking pan.

## Notes

* You can use another cookie dough recipe in lieu of the shortbread dough that I've linked to here.
* These won't make a 100% spherical ball, but the cookies are at leasta bit round.
