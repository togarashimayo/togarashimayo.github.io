# Risotto (*Sakamoto Days*, Winter 2025)

*Recipe adapted from [Love and Lemons's mushroom risotto.](https://www.loveandlemons.com/mushroom-risotto/)*

Last updated: 2026-02-12

## Ingredients
* 22.5mL olive oil
* 8oz of either oyster, cremini, portabello, or another medium/large dark brown mushroom
* 2.5mL salt
* few grains ground black pepper
* 1 medium onion
* 2 garlic cloves
* 375 mL short grain rice
* 160 mL dry white wine
* 800 - 1000 mL chicken broth/bouillon
* 125-160 mL parmesan cheese
* Parsley or dried oregano (optional)

## Steps
1. Dice the onion into 1/2 inch pieces.
2. Finely mince the garlic.
3. [Cut the parsley](https://www.wikihow.com/Cut-Parsley) if using any.  
4. Heat a large pan or wok on medium heat, and add 7.5mL olive oil, 1.25mL salt, and pepper. Once heated, add the mushrooms. Stir occasionally until soft and brown (about 8 minutes). Remove from the pan and set aside.
5. Add 15mL olive oil, onion, and 1.25mL salt. Cook for 5-8 minutes until the onion is golden yellow.
6. Stir in the garlic and rice. Toast the rice by letting it cook for about 2-3 minutes until it is opaque.
7. Add in the wine and stir until the wine evaporates from the rice.
8. Add the broth 1 cup or ladle at a time. Stir regularly and let the rice absorb all the broth before adding another cup of broth. You might not need to use all of the broth. 
9. Stir in the cheese and season to taste.
10. Top with the sauteed mushrooms and garnish with parsley.

## Notes
* I originally made this with vegetable stock and chicken boullion mixed for additional flavour. It did not work out, because the stock made the risotto an ugly brown. Trying to add yellow food colouring did not work out, because it made the entire dish look like I added Kraft Dinner powder.
