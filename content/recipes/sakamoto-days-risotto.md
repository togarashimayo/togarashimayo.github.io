# Risotto (*Sakamoto Days*, Winter 2025)

*Recipe adapted from [Love and Lemons's mushroom risotto.](https://www.loveandlemons.com/mushroom-risotto/)*

## Ingredients
* 22.5mL olive oil
* 8oz of either oyster, cremini, portabello, or another medium/large dark brown mushroom
* 2.5mL salt
* few grains ground black pepper
* 1 medium onion
* 2 garlic gloves
* Parsley
* 160 mL dry white wine
* 4-5 cups chicken broth/bouillon
* 125-160 mL parmesan cheese

## Steps
1. Dice the onion into 1/2 inch pieces.
2. Finely mince the garlic.
3. [Cut the parsley](https://www.wikihow.com/Cut-Parsley).  
4. Heat a large pan or wok on medium heat, and add 7.5mL olive oil, 1.25mL salt, and pepper. Once heated, add the mushrooms. Stir occasionally until soft and brown (about 8 minutes). Remove from the pan and set aside.
5. Add 15mL olive oil, onion, and 1.25mL salt. Cook for 5-8 minutes until the onion is golden yellow.
6. Stir in the garlic and rice. Let the rice cook for about 2-3 minutes; this is called toasting.
7. Add in the wine and stir until the wine evaporates from the rice.
8. Add the broth 1 cup at a time. Stir regularly and let the rice absorb all the broth before adding another cup of broth. You might not need to use all of the broth. 
9. Stir in the cheese and season to taste.
10. Top with the sauteed mushrooms and garnish with parsley.

## Notes
* I tried making this with vegetable stock and chicken boullion mixed for additional flavour. It did not work out, because the stock made the risotto an ugly brown. Trying to add yellow food colouring did not work out, because it made the entire dish look like it was cooked in Kraft Dinner mix.
