# "Living armour" full-course meal (Episode 3)

A set of dishes that Senshi makes from living armour, mollusk-like creatures that gather inside armour suits and contract themselves like muscles to move.

I've made all four of the below dishes with abalone, while I also made the stir-fry and soup with pre-cooked Pacific razor clams.

I would strongly recommend using the razor clams, as they're cheaper and resemble living armour more.

## Living armour drawf-style stir-fry

### Ingredients

* 12 pre-cooked Pacific razor clams, shells removed
* 1 medium onion
* 1/2 yellow bell pepper
* 350-400g spinach or bok choy
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* Eggplant (optional)
* Roast red peppers or pickled red ginger (optional)
* 1 tbsp neutral flavoured oil


### Steps
1. Wash vegetables.
2. Core the bell pepper and cut into thin strips.
3. Cut onion into half-rings.
4. Add onion and sautee until translucent.
5. Add bell pepper and sautee for 2 minutes.
6. Add greens and sautee until wilted.
7. Add oyster sauce and toss until combined.
8. Add pre-cooked razor clams and combine with the mixture. Serve immediately.

## Steamed living armour

1. Fill a pot a thirdway with water and add the steamer basket. Bring to a boil.
2. Once boiled, reduce to medium and add as much abalone as you like
3. Cover with a lid and cook for 15 minutes.

Serve with soy sauce.

## Living armour soup

*Inspired by HK pasta soup and Chinese-American egg drop soup*

### Ingredients
* 4 cups chicken broth
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 egg
* As much pre-cooked Pacific razor clams as you like (to garnish)

### Steps

1. Bring chicken broth to a boil over medium heat. 
2. Add soy sauce and oyster sauce.
3. Beat egg.
3. While continously stirring, slowly add the egg into the soup mixture.
4. Garnish with the pre-cooked razor clams.

## Grilled living armour

Grill as much abalone (or razor clams) you would like for 15 minutes, using either an acutal grill or a [grill pan](https://www.kitchenaid.com/pinch-of-help/major-appliances/how-to-grill-without-a-grill.html).
