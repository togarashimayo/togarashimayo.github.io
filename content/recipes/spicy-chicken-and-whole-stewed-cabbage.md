# Spicy chicken and whole stewed cabbage (Episode 4)

*I imagined this take more as a stew, rather than some sort of filling that you spoon on a crepe.*

## Ingredients
- 2 chicken breasts
- 2 onions
- 1 large carrot
- ½ small cabbage
- ¼ tsp cayenne powder
- 6 cups vegetable stock
- 2 tbsp chicken bullion

## Steps
1. Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces.
2. Cut onions into half-moon slices.
3. Cut carrots into 1/4 cm chunks.
4. Finely shred the cabbage.
5. In a medium-sized pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, heat 1 tbsp of medium oil. Once heated, add in the chicken and saute until it looks seared. Remove from the heat.
6. Add in the onion and cook until light golden brown (about 10-20 minutes).
7. Add the carrot and cook until softened. 
8. Add the cayenne and stir until combined. 
9. Add vegetable stock and chicken bullion and stir.
10. Add ~80% of your shredded cabbage.
11. Bring the mixture to a boil.
12. After the mixture is boiled, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook for 12-15 minutes.
13. Add in the chicken and combine. If you want to be very sure that your chicken is cooked, let the mixture cook for another 5 minutes.
14. Serve with crepes, cabbage, and bread.
