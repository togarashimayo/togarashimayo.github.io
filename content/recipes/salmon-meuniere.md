# Salmon Meuniere (Zelda: Breath of the Wild)

*[Beurre blanc recipe from Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/beurre-blanc-recipe-7643412)*

## Ingredients

### Salmon steaks

* 2 salmon steaks
* Salt and pepper
* 30 mL flour

### Tomatoes

* 4 medium-sized roasting tomatoes such as Roma
* Salt, pepper, and herb seasoning

### Salad

* 8 oz of your favourite salad greens (I prefer spring greens)
* 80 mL cup oil (I used avocado)
* 80 mL cup of vinegar or lemon juice (I used white wine vinegar)
* 15 mL maple syrup or honey

### Sauce

* 1/2 medium shallot
* 30 mL dry white wine
* 15 mL white wine vinegar
* 65g cold unsalted butter 

## Steps

### Salmon steaks

1. [Debone the salmon steak](https://champagne-tastes.com/how-to-debone-salmon-steaks/) (link for those who haven’t deboned).
2. In a medium pan with butter or oil over medium heat, cook the salmon on one side for 5 minutes. Flip over and cook for another 5 minutes.
3. Remove from the heat.

### Roasted tomatoes

1. Halve tomatoes lengthwise.
2. Season with salt, pepper, and mixed herb seasoning.
3. Bake for 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees.

### Sauce

1. Cut the butter into 1" cubes. Chill in the fridge while you create the reduction.
2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine white wine, shallots, and white wine vinegar. Reduce until you have 7.5-15 mL of liquid left.
3. Gradually whisk in the butter cubes (1-2 at a time) into the sauce. You should either have a milky emulsion or shallot-flavoured butter.

### Salad
In a mason jar, add oil, acid, and either the maple syrup or honey. Shake until mixed, and use the dressing in your salad greens.

## Notes
* The original BOTW recipe mentions goat butter. While game-accurate, I wouldn’t recommend using goat butter. The butter‘s gaminess amplifies the fish‘s fishiness and detract from the rest of the dish.
