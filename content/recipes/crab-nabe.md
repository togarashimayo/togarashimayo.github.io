# Crab nabe (*Dandadan S1*, Fall 2024)

*[Nabe broth recipe adapted from Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/yosenabe/)*

## Ingredients

### Broth
* 1L dashi
* 60 mL sake
* 60 mL mirin
* 60 mL light soy sauce
* 5 mL salt

### Nabe ingredients
* 3 clusters precooked snow crab
* 1/2 piece napa cabbage
* 1/2 bunch of spinach
* 4 shiitake mushrooms (optional)
* Other ingredients you might like?

## Steps

1. In a large pot, combine dashi, sake, mirin, soy, sauce,  and salt. Cover and simmer before turning off the heat and setting aside.
2. Separate the legs from the knuckle of each cluster. Use the cluster for something else; we will just need the legs.
3. Wash the spinach and remove the bottom parts.
4. Remove the core from the napa cabbage, separate the leaves, and rinse them carefully. 
5. Remove the stems from the shiitake mushroom.
6. Bring the broth to a boil. Add in the vegetables, close the lid, and cook until the leafy greens are almost (5 min).
7. Rewarm the legs for a minute or two in the hot broth.
8. Enjoy while hot!

## Notes
* You can use imitation crab or another crab instead of the snow crab, but I haven't tested this recipe with them.
* I used the snow crab clusters from Costco.
* The show features what seems to be white asparagus, which is often only available in the spring. Omit it if it's not in-season.
