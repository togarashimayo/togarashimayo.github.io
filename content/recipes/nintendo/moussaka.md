# "I ate the eggplant wizard" moussaka (Kid Icarus inspired)

#TODO write full recipe

I used the [Mediterranean Dish's](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/vegetarian-moussaka-recipe/) recipes but:
* Omitted the zucchini
* Used 1.5 lbs of nugget yellow potatoes instead of russet potatoes.
* Used whole milk instead of 2% milk for the bechamal.
* Used a drained 14 oz can of cooked lentils instead of black lentils.
