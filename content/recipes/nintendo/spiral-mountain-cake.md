# Spiral Mountain Honey Cake (Banjo Kazooie inspired)

*Recipe adapted from the [The Little Book of Rarecipes](https://archive.org/details/rarecipe)*

## Ingredients
* 150g roughtly-chopped pitted dates
* 75g unsalted butter
* 35g of your favourite sweetener
* 250g peeled and roughly chopped bananas (about 2 large bananas)
* 3 eggs
* 200g all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 320 degrees F.
2. In a food processor, add the chopped dates, butter, sweetener, and very hot water. Stir and let them soak/melt for 5-10 minutes.
3. Add banana chunks and eggs, blend until smooth, and spat out the mixture into a medium mixing bowl.
4. Sift the flour, baking powder, and baking soda into the mixture. Mix until well-combined.
4. Pour the batter into a greased/floured loaf tin and bake the cake for 1 hour in the oven.
6. Remove the loaf tin from the oven. Let it sit for 10 minutes, before removing and cutting.

## Notes
* For my "favourite sweetener", I used 25 mL of blueberry syrup (by accident because it was in a honey bottle) and 10 mL of honey. The original rewcipe uses light brown soft sugar.
