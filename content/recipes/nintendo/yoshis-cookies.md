# Yoshi's Cookies

#TODO write full recipe

*These cookies are based on the NES take*

## Sugar cookie base

I halved the [Allrecipes's Best rolled sugar cookies](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10402/the-best-rolled-sugar-cookies/) recipe. For shaping the cookies:
* Square: I cut out squares with a knife, before making a dent in the centre.
* Flower: I used a 1.75" cookie cutter from Bulk Barn, before making a dent in the centre.
* Circle: I used a shot glass and cut out holes with a toothpick, before dusting the cookie in cinnamon sugar (1:1 cinammon:sugar)
* Heart/Linzer: I cut out heart shapes with a 2" cookie cutter. For every second cookie, I cut out another heart out of the heart shaped cookie.

### Decorating the cookies
* Flower & square: I added a small amount of royal icing to the dent before adding a Smartie on top of it (purple for flower; green for square)
* Heart/Linzer: I added a bit of lingonberry jam on a solid heart cookie, before sandwiching a heart outline cookie on top.

## Checkerboard cookies

I used the [Cookies and Cups](https://cookiesandcups.com/checkerboard-cookies/) checkerboard recipe. However instead of cutting each dough into nine strips like in the original recipe, I cut my dough into four strips.
