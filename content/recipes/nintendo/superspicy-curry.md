# Superspicy curry (Kirby)

#TODO write full recipe

I used [Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook's beef curry recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-beef-curry/). However, I:

* Used velvetted beef stew cubes instead of beef chuck roast. I wrote a bit about how to velvet beef in my [Yor's Stew recipe](../spy_x_family/yors_stew.md).
* Used yellow nugget potatoes instead of russet potatoes.
* Added 2.5 mL chili powder and 2.5 mL cayenne powder at the start. Then added another 2.5 mL cayenee powder at the end. 
* Subsituted soy sauce Worcestershire sauce.
* Used hot curry roux, specifically House's brand.
* Added in six drops of deep red food colouring.
