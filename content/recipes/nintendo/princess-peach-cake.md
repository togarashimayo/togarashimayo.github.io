# Princess Peach's cake (Super Mario 64)

#TODO write full recipe

## Strawberry shortcake base

To make the strawberry shortcake, I used [Omnivore Cookbook's recipe](https://omnivorescookbook.com/japanese-strawberry-shortcake/) but:
* Multiplied the ingredients by 1.5x.
* Used a 5" springform pan as the top layer and a 9" springform pan as the bottom layer.
* Did not stabilize my cream.
* Stacked and assembled the small cake (after cutting into halves) on the assembled large cake.

## Star decoration

### Ingredients
* Sugar cookie dough
* Yellow and black icing

### Steps

1. Make or buy your sugar cookie dough.
2. Roll out your dough to 1/4 inch and use a 2.75" star cookie cutter.
3. Bake the cookie before letting it cool according to your cookie dough recipe's instructions.
4. Frost the cookie with yellow icing, before drawing two black "eyes" on the cookie.

## Chocolate plating

1. Melt some semisweet or milk chocolate chips in the microwave.
2. On parchment, use a spatula, a piping bag, or a sandwich bag with a small hole in the corner to draw a 6 x 2" rectangle. Freeze that until the chocolate sets.
3. Melt about 15 grams of white chocolate chips.
4. Transfer chocolate to a piping bag or a sandwich bag with a very small hole in the corner.
5. Pipe "THANK YOU" in capital letters.
6. Keep in the freezer until it's time to decorate.

## Putting it all together

Using the source image as a guide...

1. For the whipped cream decoration on the bottom cake, fill a disposable piping bag with whipped cream and a star-shaped nozzle (Wilton 1M). Make swirls before topping with a strawberry.
2. For the whipped cream decoration on the top cake, use that same piping bag to pipe some whipped cream before pulling upwards at 90 degrees ([video example from Hafsa's Kitchen](https://youtu.be/c4i3w4g7eyA?feature=shared&t=200)). Top with a cherry, preferrably Ranier.
3. Add the "thank you" chocolate plate at the front of the cake.
4. Add the star shape at the back of the cake but in front of the cherries. 
5. If using any, top the cake with sanitized Mario and Peach figures.
