# Princess Peach's cake (Super Mario 64)

#TODO write full recipe

## Strawberry shortcake base

To make the strawberry shortcake, I used [Omnivore Cookbook's recipe](https://omnivorescookbook.com/japanese-strawberry-shortcake/) but:
* Multiplied the ingredients by 1.5x.
* Used a 5" springform pan as the top layer and a 9" springform pan as the bottom layer.
* Did not stabilize my cream.

## Star decoration

### Ingredients
* Sugar cookie dough

### Steps

1. Make or buy your sugar cookie dough.
2. Roll out your dough to 1/4 inch and use a 2.75" star cookie cutter.
3. Bake the cookie before letting it cool according to your cookie dough recipe's instructions.

## Chocolate plating

1. Melt some semisweet or milk chocolate chips in the microwave.
2. On parchment.
3. Melt about 15 grams of white chocolate chips.
4. Transfer chocolate to a piping bag or a sandwich bag with a very small hole in the corner.
5. Pipe "THANK YOU" in capital letters.
6. Keep in the freezer until it's time to decorate

## Putting it all together
