# Peanut chicken schnitzel

*Adapted from Luisa Weis's Wiener Schnitzel recipe from Classic German Cooking. If you're here because you scanned the recipe's QR code during my panel, I used [the peanut sauce recipe from The Little Kitchen](https://www.thelittlekitchen.net/peanut-sauce/).*

## Ingredients
* 2 chicken breasts
* 250g / 500mL all-purpose flour
* 4 eggs
* 15 mL water
* 4 tbsp vegetable oil plus at least 1/2 cup oil for frying
* 500-750mL fine breadcrumbs

## Steps
1. Beat the eggs in a wide shallow bowl. Whisk in 4 tbsp of the oil and water. Set aside.
2. Add flour in another wide shallow bowl.
3. Add breadcrumbs in another wide shallow bowl.
4. Butterfly the chicken breasts and pound until thin with a meat mallet or a rolling pin. 
5. Dredge each breast in flour, coat in the egg wash, and dredge in the bread crumbs
6. Pour 1/2 to 1 cup of oil in a small skillet, and set over medium-high heat. When hot, add a cutlet into the pan. Cook on one side for 3-5 minutes.
7. Flip chicken breast and cook for another 3-5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel.

## Notes
* I like buying bread on sale, drying them, and turning them into fine breadcrumbs by grinding them into a food processor.
