# Croquette (*Umamusume Cinderella Grey*, Spring 2025)

Adapted from [Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook's recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/moms-korokke-croquette/).

## Ingredients
* 5 lbs russet potatoes
* 1 tsp salt
* couple dashes of pepper
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 large onions
* 2 lbs frozen mixed veggies
* at least 125 mL all-purpose flour
* 5 cups panko
* 7-8 large eggs

## Steps

### Potatoes
1. Wash, peel, and remove the eyes from the potatoes. Cut into large chunks.
2. Place potatoes into a large pot, fill with cold water, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Partially cover with a lid.
3. Once you can stab a potato with a knife without struggle, drain the potatoes and set the heat to medium. 
4. Keep stirring until the potatoes look dry and powdery.
5. Mash and season with salt, pepper, and olive oil.

### Veggie mixture + mixing it with the potatoes

1. Finely chop the onion.
2. In a large skillet on medium heat, add 1/4 cup neutral oil. Once heated, add in the onions and saute until translucent.
3. Add in the veggies and cook till warm.
4. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Drain the veggie mixture.
6. Gradually add the veggie mixture to the potatoes, mixing after adding each portion. 

### Making and cooing the patties
1. While the mixture is warm, form oval 3-inch long patties. Avoid making air pockets, otherwise the patties could explode when heated.
2. Place patties on a tray or place, before letting it cool for 30 minutes.
3. Prepare separate trays containing the flour, beaten eggs, and panko.
4. Dredge the patty with flour, before dipping in beaten egg, and then coating with panko. You might have to gently press the croquette to help the breadcrumb stick to it.
5. Add a couple tablespoons of neutral oil to a skillet and heat over medium.
6. Cook croquettes on each side until golden brown.
7. Transfer to either a wire rack or plate lined with paper towels. Repeat for the rest of the patties.
