# Beef wellington

Recipe adapted from [Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/beef_wellington/) (roast) and [Rachel Ray's Mockbraten](https://rachaelray.com/blogs/recipes/mockbraten-flank-steak-with-sauerbraten-style-sauce-smashed-potatoes-with-horseradish-and-chives-and-red-cabbage-with-apple-and-onions) (marinade, sauce)

## Ingredients

### Marinade
* 40 mL apple cider vinegar
* 22.5 mL sugar
* 15 mL herb seasoning (I used Dash)
* 22.5 mL vegetable oil
* 3 juniper berries (optional)

### Beef wellington

* 1.5 lb tenderoin roast
* 12 oz thawed frozen puff pastry
* 680 grams cremini mushrooms
* 200 grams parma ham
* 2 egg yolks

### Sauce
* 1 clove garlic
* 30 mL all-purpose flour
* 60 mL dry red wine
* 188 mL beef broth
* 3 gingersnap cookies

## Steps

### Meat
1. Combine the marinade ingredients in a large freezer bag. Add the tenderloin and let marinate for 1 hour in the fridge. 
2. In a skillet with 30 mL neutral oil over medium heat, sear the beef on all sides for 2 minutes each. Let cool. DO NOT WASH THE PAN.

### Mushrooms
1. Cut mushrooms into large chunks, and blend in a food processor until you have a moist paste. 
2. In a non-stick skillet over medium heat, cook the mushrooms until they are dry. Let cool to room temperature.

### Assembly

1. Slice a plastic wrap that is around the same size as your roast. Arrange the parma ham so it's close to the size of the plastic wrap, before spreading the mushroom paste on the ham.
2. Roll up the tenderloin in the ham, before tightly wrapping in plastic wrap so it molds to the tenderloin. Chill for 30 minutes.
3. Roll the thawed puff pastry to a rectangle around the same size as your roast.
4. Separate the yolks from the whites of two eggs. Those yolks will be your egg wash for the pastry.
5. Place the meat on the puff pastry. Brush the pastry's edges with the egg wash.
6. Fold the edges around the beef. You may have to cut off the edges as thick pastry won't cook. (Why not bake the scraps as themselves and eat them as a snack?)
7. Place roast on a plate seam-side down. Chill for 5-10 minutes.
8. Brush the roast with the remaining egg yolks. Make horizontal scores and sprinkle with salt.
9. Bake for 400 degrees between 25-30 minutes.
10. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut with a sharp knife.

### Sauce
1. Mince the garlic.
2. Saute the garlic on medium heat until fragrant.
3. Add in the flour and combine with the drippings to create a roux.
4. Whisk in the wine until combined
5. Whisk in the beef broth and bring to a simmer.
6. Crumble the gingersnap cookies in your hands and add to the sauce. 
7. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
8. Let thicken.
