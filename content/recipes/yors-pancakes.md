# Yor’s pancakes / Mint chocolate kebab

*Adapted from Luisa Weiss's Eierkuchen/Pfannkuchen recipe from [Classic German Cooking](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/716001/classic-german-cooking-by-luisa-weiss/).*

## Ingredients

### Pancakes

- 2 eggs
- 15 mL melted butter
- 500 mL whole milk
- 250 grams flour
- 1.25 mL salt
- 35 mL sparkling water
- 35 mL boiling water

### Compote

- 454 grams strawberries
- 60 mL sugar
- 15 mL lemon juice
- 2.5 mL vanilla extract (optional)

### Mint chocolate kebab

- 1 pancake
- 125 mL heavy cream
- 15 mL granulated or icing sugar
- 1.25 mL mint extract
- 2-3 chocolate mint cookies (optional; I like Girl *Scout* thin mints)

## Steps

### Compote

1. Cut strawberries into quarters.
2. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring all ingredients to a simmer while stirring occasionally. 
3. Cook for about 20 minutes if you want a slightly runny sauce, and for 30 minutes if you want a jam-like texture.
4. Let cool.

### Pancakes

1. Bear the eggs in a medium bowl.
2. Add milk, melted butter, and salt and stir
3. Stir in the flour until smooth.
4. Gradually stir in the sparkling and boiled water. Let it rest for 15 minutes
5. In a ~30 cm non-stick skillet over medium heat, add a spoonful of the batter and try to spread/shake the batter so the batter spreads evenly.
6. When you see small bubbles on the pancake (about a minute), flip the pancake and cook for 30-60 seconds.
7. Serve on a plate and keep using the batter to cook more pancakes.
8. Shape the pancake into an American football (seam side down) and spoon on the compote!

### Mint chocolate kebab

1. In a cold metal or glass bowl, add the whipping cream, sugar, and mint extract. Mix using a whisk or an electric mixer until the cream is firm with soft peaks.
2. On a finished crepe, sprinkle chocolate shavings.
3. Spoon on the whipped cream.
4. Drizzle with a chocolate sauce/spread (I used Nutella)
5. Top with chocolate mint cookies (optional).
6. Roll the kebab or fold it like a crepe.

## Notes

- I like to eat leftover pancakes with cinnamon and sugar.
