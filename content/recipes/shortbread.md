# Shortbread dough

*Base recipe adapted from [View from the Great Island](https://theviewfromgreatisland.com/one-cookie-dough-12-ways/). Massive thank you to both [Bev Tsang and Grey Uyeda (Aiyaohno Cafe)](https://aiyaohno.com/) for concieving some of the mix-in modifications through their feedback*

This is the cookie base that I use for both the tea snacks from Spy x Family S3 and the Poffins from Pokemon. 

## Ingredients

### Base

* 227 grams softened unsweetened butter
* 100 grams white sugar
* 1.25 mL salt
* 5 mL vanilla extract
* 250 grams flour

### Mix-ins (choose one for each dough)
* 36 grams of ground-up freeze dried strawberries (Reduce the amount of sugar by 36g)
* 45 mL tbsp matcha
* 5 mL cinnamon (I like switching the sugar to brown if making cinnamon cookies)

## Steps

1. Mix sugar, butter, salt, vanilla, and mix-ins.
2. Add the flour until it turns into a dough.
3. Shape dough into a disk (if cutting shapes out of it) or a log (if cutting rounds out of it) and cover with plastic wrap. 
3. Chill in the fridge for at least two hours, or even better, overnight.
4. Shape into your desired shapes!
