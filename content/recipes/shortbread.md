# Shortbread dough

*Base recipe adapted from [View from the Great Island](https://theviewfromgreatisland.com/one-cookie-dough-12-ways/). Massive thank you to both [Bev Tsang and Grey Uyeda (Aiyaohno Cafe)](https://aiyaohno.com/), Angela from nwPlus, for concieving some of the mix-in modifications through their feedback*

This is the cookie base that I use for both the tea snacks from Spy x Family S3 and the Poffins from Pokemon. 

## Ingredients

### Base

* 227 grams softened unsweetened butter
* 100 grams white sugar
* 1.25 mL salt
* 5 mL vanilla extract (optional)
* 250 grams flour

### Mix-ins (choose one for each dough)
* Strawberry - 36 grams of ground-up freeze dried strawberries (Reduce the amount of sugar by 36g, as these strawberries are sweet!)
* Matcha - 45 mL tbsp matcha
* Cinnamon - 5 mL cinnamon (I like switching the sugar to brown if making cinnamon cookies)
* Lemon - 1 lemon and 5 mL lemon extract

## Steps

### Lemon sugar

1. Peel the lemon, trying to not get the bitter white stuff (pith)
2. Blend 100 grams of sugar with the lemon peel.
3. Use in lieu of plain sugar for the cookie base.

### Cookie base

1. Mix sugar, butter, salt, vanilla, and mix-ins.
2. Add the flour until it turns into a dough.
3. Shape dough into a disk (if cutting shapes out of it) or a log (if cutting rounds out of it) and cover with plastic wrap. 
3. Chill in the fridge for at least two hours, or even better, overnight.
4. Shape into your desired shapes!

## Notes
* When making everyday cutouts, I roll the dough to 1/4" and bake at 325 degrees for 10 minutes. (Bev prefers that her shortbread is crunchy)
* Chill in the fridge for up to three days. Otherwise your dough might start to taste like your fridge's contents!
* You can freeze your leftover dough if you don't want to bake the cookies immediately. I froze some leftover dough for both my volunteer organization and a family member's place of worship.
* This cookie also goes well with the tire donuts. Keith and one of Mira's children tried this. 
* I strongly recommend using "ceremonial" grade matcha for these cookies.
