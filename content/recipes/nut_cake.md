# Caramel nut cake for Anya

*Adapted from REWE's [Tiroler Nusskuchen recipe (in German)](https://www.rewe.de/rezepte/tiroler-nusskuchen/) and [Natasha's Kitchen caramel sauce recipe](https://natashaskitchen.com/easy-caramel-sauce-recipe/)*

This cake doesn't make a physical appearance when Loid buys it for Anya. However, this is my speculation on what it could look like. 

A massive thank you to Anakbayan Surrey for being my taste testers.


## Ingredients:

### Nut cake

* 6 medium-sized eggs
* 1 pinch salt
* 200g room temperature butter
* 200g white sugar
* 130g all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 125g ground-up hazelnuts
* 125g chopped hazelnuts
* 200g chocolate chips

### Caramel sauce

* 200g light brown sugar
* 57g unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 Tbsp vanilla extract

## Steps

### Nut cake

1. Preheat the oven to 356 F (180 C). Grease a loaf pan (ideally 26 cm) with butter and sprinkle with flour. 
2. Seperate the eggs. 
3. Beat the egg whites [until stiff](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/soft-peaks-stiff-peaks/).  
4. Cream the egg yolks, butter, and sugar using a hand mixer.
5. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking soda,and both ground-up and chopped hazelnuts. Fold in the chocolate chips and then the egg meringue. 
6. Pour the mixture into the greased loaf pan and bake for an hour. In the meantime, make your caramel sauce.
7. Remove from the oven and let cool. 
8. Cut the cake into slices and drizzle the sauce on each slice.

### Caramel sauce

1. Combine butter, sugar, and vanilla and bring to a boil.
2. Stir in the milk and bring that again to a boil. Remove from the heat.

### Notes

* If you're like me, you can use butter wrappers to grease your pans.
* I used chocolate chips from Costco.
* You must use a glass or metal bowl without any traces of fat on it to make the meringue. Otherwise, your meringue won't whip!
* You must eat this with a fork, as the cake is too light to be picked up by hand and eaten like finger food.
