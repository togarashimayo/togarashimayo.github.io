# Lemon chicken (*Kowloon Generic Romance*, Spring 2025)
 
*Recipe adapted from both [Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-lemon-chicken/) (coating) and [Chinese Cooking Demystified](https://old.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/as9g4u/recipe_lemon_chicken_the_original_cantonese_style/) (sauce and marinade)*

## Ingredients

### Chicken + marinade
* 1 lb chicken breast
* 5 mL salt
* 5 mL sugar
* 2.5 mL white pepper
* 10 mL Shaoxing wine
* 10 mL light soy sauce (I used Kikkoman)

### Sauce
* 1 lemon
* 100 mL water w/ 10 mL chicken stock concentrate
* 20 mL sugar
* 2.5 mL milk powder
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 inches ginger
* 10 mL Shaoxing wine
* 10 mL corn or potato starch

Optional: lemon slices to garnish

### Coating

* 250 mL cornstarch
* 60mL all-purpose flour
* 2.5 mL salt
* 2.5 mL white pepper
* 2.5 mL sesame oil
* Pinch turmeric powder (optional)

## Steps

### Prep
1. Cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.
2. In a bowl, combine the sugar, salt, white pepper, Shaoxing wine, and soy sauce. Add the chicken breast and massage the mixture into the chicken. Chill for at least 2 hours.
3. Smash the garlic cloves and ginger.
4. Zest the lemon, cut into slices, and squeeze the juice.

### Sauce
1. In a small pot over medium heat, add 7.5mL tbsp of oil. Add the garlic and ginger and stir until fragrent. 
2. Add the Shaoxing wine (it will splatter) and the sauce. Bring to a boil, before removing the garlic and ginger.
3. Add the lemon juice and zest, before simmering for 15s. 
4. Add the slurry.
5. Let boil for 30s until thickened, before setting the sauce aside.

### Cooking
1. Heat up 1 cup of neutral oil in a wok or a medium pot over medium heat.
2. Combine the starch, flour, salt, white pepper, oil, and tumeric if using.
3. Dredge the chicken in the starch.
4. Once the oil is heated, drop up to 6 pieces of chicken in the pot and fry for about 2-3 minutes.
5. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and drain on either a plate with paper towels, or a wire rack. Repeat until you've fried all the chicken.

### Serving
Add the chicken to a plate, pour sauce over it, and garnish with lemon slices. Serve immediately.

## Notes
* I marinated my chicken for 6h.
* If you don't have a microplane, you can peel the lemon while avoiding the white stuff (pith) and then finely mincing it.
* Can subsitute olive oil for sesame oil if you don't have any on hand, but it will change the flavour profile.
* If you have a wooden chopstick, you can use it to test oil temperature by putting the chopstick tip in the oil and seeing whether it bubbles. (It bubbles when it is hot enough)
* I didn't do this when first making the chicken, but you can twice (or thrice) fry the chicken. I've elaborated a bit about it while making [the marinated chicken from *The Summer Hikaru Died*](./marinated-chicken-karaage.md).
