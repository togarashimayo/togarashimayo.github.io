# Loid's hambagu

*Hambagu recipe adapted from [Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook's recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/hamburger-steak-hambagu/). The roasted tomatoes and potato wedges are my own recipe.*

*Massive thank you to [Sam from Otakuthon](https://old.reddit.com/user/LoadingRevived) for [making this recipe and sharing it with me](https://old.reddit.com/r/SpyxFamily/comments/1morny1/i_tried_making_loids_hamburger_steak_from_spy_x/)!*

## Ingredients (serves four)

### Hambagu mince

* 1/2 onion
* 12oz ground meat (I like 4oz pork and 8oz beef)
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg or cinnamon
* 1/3 cup [breadcrumbs made from milk bread](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-breadcrumbs/)
* 2 tbsp half and half cream
* 1 egg

### Cooking the patties

* 1 tbsp neutral oil
* 3 tbsp red wine or grape juice

### Cooking the sauce

* 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* 3 tbsp tomato paste
* 3 tbsp tonkatsu or takoyaki sauce
* 3 tbsp red wine (use grape juice for a non-alcoholic/halal subsitute)
* 3 tbsp water

### Fried potato (Bratkartoffeln) wedges

* 1 lb [waxy potatoes](https://bakeitwithlove.com/potato-guide-to-starchy-waxy-all-purpose-best-uses/#waxy-potatoes) such as Yukon Gold
* 1/2 onion
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1 tbsp neutral oil

### Veggies

* 1/2 lb grape tomatoes
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 crown broccoli


## Steps

### Hambagu

1. Finely mince the onions into 1/8 inch pieces.
2. Heat a frying pan on medium heat and add your oil. When the oil is hot enough, sautee the onions until transparent.
3. Transfer the onions to a medium sized bowl and let cool.
4. Add the meat to the bowl of onions. Add the salt, pepper, breadcrumbs, half and half cream, and eggs, and stir until combined.
5. Knead your dough until pale and sticky.
6. Toss your hambagu to remove air (and thus cracks) from the hambagu.
7. Chill for 30 minutes.
8. Heat 1 tbsp of neutral oil over medium heat in a frying pan. Once the oil is hot, add the patties and cook for 3 minutes.
9. Flip the patties and cook for another 3 minutes.
10. Add the red wine and cover the pan. Let that cook for 5-7 minutes.
11. Remove the patties from the frying pan. **Do not wash the pan. You will still need the drippings for sauce**

### Sauce

1. Add unsalted butter, tomato paste, tonkatsu or takoyaki sauce, red wine, and water to the frying pan full of pan drippings.
2. Stir until combine and bring to a boil over high heat.
3. The sauce is ready once it covers the back of a spoon or spatula.

### Fried potato (Bratkartoffeln) wedges

1. Cut your washed potatoes into wedges.
2. Par-boil the potatoes by putting them in a pot of cold water. Bring that to a boil and immediately remove from heat once the water boils.
3. Dice the onion into 1/4 inch pieces.
4. Heat fats on medium heat in a large frying pan. When heated, add the onions and saute until transparent. Remove the onions from the pan.
5. Add in the potato wedges and repeatedly toss the potatoes until crispy.
6. Re-add the onions and toss to combine.

### Veggies

1. Toss the grape tomatoes in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Tray on a parchment paper lined tray and bake for 12-15 minutes at 400 degrees.
2. Cut the broccoli in to small florets and [steam](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/steamed_broccoli/). 

## Notes
* Replacing the wine with grape juice will make the sauce taste sweeter and tangier.
* You can subsitute the half-and-half cream and milk bread bread crumbs with milk and panko bread crumbs respectively (like in Namiko's original recipe). But it will be less flavourful.
* If you want to add more flavour to the potatoes while sacrificing accuracy, you can add bell peppers like Sam did.
* You can also cook the broccoli in chicken broth. It will add a subtle chicken flavour to the broccoli, and you can also drink the (broccoli-flavoured) chicken broth on the side.
