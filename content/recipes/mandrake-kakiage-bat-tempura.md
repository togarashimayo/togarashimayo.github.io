# Mandrake kakiage and big bat tempura (Episode 2)

## Mandrake kakiage

### Ingredients
- 300g daikon
- 100g spinach
- 60g all purpose flour
- ½ cup water
- About 1 cup of neutral flavoured oil for frying

### Steps
1. Cut daikon into long yet thin strips (the thinner; the better)
2. Separate the spinach leaves from the stalks.
3. Heat a small saucepan with the oil on medium heat.
3. In a large bowl, combine the daikon and spinach leaves together.
4. Add the flour and combine.
5. Add the water and combine.
6. Take a small shovelful of batter and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side.
7. Drain on a paper towel.


## Big bat tempura

### Ingredients
- 1 lb chicken breast or thigh
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup mirin or sake
- 1 tbsp garlic (optional)
- 1 cup *ice cold* water
- ¾ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- ¼ tsp baking powder
- Enough oil for deep frying. (I recommend avocado oil)

### Steps
*These steps assume that you are making the tempura after the kakiage*

1. Cut chicken into 1/4-1/2 inch thick medallions.
2. Marinate the chicken in soy sauce, mirin, and garlic. Put in the fridge for an hour.
3. In a bowl, mix water, flour, corn starch, and baking powder.
4. For each marinated medallion, dip in the batter, shake off the excess batter, and place in the oil-filled saucepan.
5. Fry until golden brown on one side.
6. Flip over and fry until golden brown on the other side. This should take 3-5 minutes.
7. Drain pieces on a plate lined with a paper towel.
