# Apple tart for Yor

*Adapted from [Cuisine Helvetica's apple tart recipe](https://cuisinehelvetica.com/2022/09/15/recipe-swiss-apple-tart/)* 



## Ingredients (makes at least 12 individually sized tarts)

### Dough
* 200g all-purpose flour
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 75g _cold_ unsalted butter
* 1 slightly-beaten egg
* 1-2 tbsp _cold_ water

### Filling
* 2-3 tbsp lemon juice (one lemon)
* 2 tbsp almond flour
* 1 kg baking apple
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter, diced
* 3 tbsp honey

## Steps

### Crust
1. Combine flour and salt. 
2. Cut in the unsalted butter using a pastry blender, two knives, or your hands until it resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Make a well in your dough and add both the egg and water. Stir. 
4. Chill the dough for 30-60 min.
5. Roll the chilled dough using a lighly floured rolling pin to 1/8-1/6". Using a 2.5" cookie cutter or a ramekin, punch rounds out of the dough.
6. Fit those rounds into a 12-cup muffin pan. [Pierce the bottoms with a fork](https://flavorycooking.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-piercing-the-bottom-of-a-one-crust-pie-with-a-fork/). Then sprinkle the rounds with almond flour. Chill the pan while making the filling. 

### Filling
1. Add lemon juice to a large bowl. 
2. Peel, core, and cut the apples into thin slices. 
3. Toss the apples in the juice. This prevents the apples from browning. Take the chilled dough in the muffin tin out of the fridge and arrange the apples into a single layer in each tin. Sprinkle with one tablespoon of sugar and top the apples with small pieces of butter evenly distributed.

### Putting it all together
1. Fill each tart shell with the apples.
2. Top each tart with 1/4 tsp sugar and 1/4 butter.
3. Bake at 375 degrees for 40-45 minutes
4. Brush honey on all the tarts.
5. Let cool and serve with [vanilla sauce](https://www.daringgourmet.com/vanillesosse-german-vanilla-sauce/)!

## Notes
* I used Granny Smith, but you can use a similar or sweeter apple based on your personal tastes.
