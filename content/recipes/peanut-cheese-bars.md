# Peanut cheese bars (Earthbound / MOTHER 2)

#TODO write full recipe

## Oreo crust

I used [Sally's Baking Addiction's recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/oreo-cookie-crust/), but used 250g of Oreos since who knows if the Oreos shrink because of shrinkflation?

## Flling and topping

I used the [Heather's Home Bakery recipe](https://heathershomebakery.com/2023/06/07/no-bake-peanut-butter-cheesecake/) but:
* Used a 9" square pan instead of a 9" spring form pan.
* Used two cream cheese bars instead of three bars.
* Did not make the peanut butter mousse.
* Sprinkled peanuts on the ganache before the cheesecake goes into the fridge to set.
