# Spy x Family - Croquette shop croquette

*Recipe adapted from [All Taste German's croquette recipe](https://alltastesgerman.com/kroketten-german-croquettes/)*

## Ingredients

- 1 kg russet potatoes
- 2 eggs
- 45 mL butter
- 45 mL cornstarch
- 1 tsp salt
- Couple grinds of pepper
- About 250 mL flour
- About 250 mL of fine breadcrumbs
- About 1L of cooking oil

## Steps

1. Peel potatoes before cutting into preferably 1" chunks (this speeds up the cooking process).
2. In a large pot, boil potatoes over medium-high heat. Once you can pierce a potato with (say) a fork without much force, put the pot back on the stove but on medium-low heat. Cook until the potatoes are dry and powdery, otherwise they risk exploding when you fry them. 
3. Mash the potatoes. You can some chunks for texture if you’d like. Let cool to room temperature.
4. Separate the eggs. Add the yolks, plus the salt, pepper, and butter to the potatoes. Add the whites to a bowl that can fit your croquettes.
5. Shape your mash into either oval patties or 4” rods. Tray on a baking sheet, cover, and chill for 30 minutes.
6. Prepare the rest of the breading station by adding flour into a shallow baking dish and breadcrumbs into another shallow baking dish
7. Bread the croquettes. For each croquette, dredge the croquette in flour, before spinning in egg whites, and tossing in the breadcrumbs.
8. Heat up enough oil to fill 1” of the pot you’re cooking the croquettes out of. 
9. For each croquette, cook until one side is golden brown before flipping over and cooking that side till golden brown. Let drain before placing on a paper towel lined dish. Serve immediately.
