# Curry udon (*My Dressup Darling*, Summer 2025)

*Recipe adapted from [Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook's recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/curry-udon/)*

## Ingredients (serves two)

* Half an onion
* 120-150g portion of a large carot
* Half a zucchini
* Green onions
* 8oz thinly sliced beef
* 15 mL sake
* 750 mL dashi
* 2 blocks of packaged curry
* 2 tsbp Japanese soy sauce
* 2 packages udon, cooked according to package instructions

## Steps

### Prep
1. Cut the onion into large chunks.
2. Cut the carrot into 1/4 quarter coins.
3. Diagonally cut the zucchini.
4. Thinly slice the green onions
5. Cut the beef into bite-sized pieces

### Cooking
1. Heat a medium pot on medium heat. Once hot, add 1 tbsp neutral oil.
2. Saute the onion slices for 2-3 minutes until translucent.
3. Add the beef and saute until it is no longer pink.
4. Add the zucchini, carrots, onion, and dashi.
5. Cover the lid and let cook until the vegetables are tender.
6. While simmering, [skim off the scum and fat with a spoon (or even better a fine mesh sieve)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-skim-off-the-scum-and-fat-from-soups-and-stocks/).
7. Once the veggies are soft, place a curry block in a ladle and then in the soup. Let the block dissolve into that soup, before repeating with another block.
8. Add the soy sauce.
9. Place cooked noodles in a large bowl and spoon some broth over the noodles. Garnish with the green onions. 

## Notes
* You can use any udon, but my parner and I prefer the frozen sanuki udon because of the texture.
